**Preflight status (all must be YES before submitting):**

- [ ] Public contact monitored (same bar as the registry preflight).
- [ ] Standard MCP endpoint enabled on a live deployment.
- [ ] Registry preflight passed against that deployment.

# Agent Middleware API

**MCP authorization gateway for agent-to-tool actions.**

Agent Middleware API authorizes one configured upstream MCP tool under a
wallet-scoped permit. One accepted idempotency key permits at most one gateway
dispatch and wallet debit; signed receipts and audit evidence record the
terminal gateway outcome.

Canonical loop: `discover -> authenticate -> authorize -> invoke -> meter -> receipt -> audit -> govern`.

## Capabilities

- **Scoped authority** — signed permits bind wallet, key, tool, budget, and expiry
- **Replay-safe metering** — at most one gateway debit and dispatch per accepted idempotency key
- **Remote MCP dispatch** — one operator-configured HTTPS Streamable HTTP tool
- **Signed evidence** — receipts link permit, ledger, dispatch state, and audit
- **Explicit uncertainty** — ambiguous post-dispatch failures are signed and not retried

AWI, browser, RAG, sandbox, telemetry, and orchestration code in the repository
is disabled proof-surface scaffolding, not part of this listing.

## Quick Start

```python
from b2a_sdk import AgentMiddlewareClient, PermitRequest

client = AgentMiddlewareClient(
    base_url="https://api.thisisatest.tech",
    api_key="your-api-key",
)

permit = await client.create_permit(
    PermitRequest(...),
    idempotency_key="permit-01",
)
result = await client.invoke_tool(
    "partner.tool",
    {"input": "value"},
    wallet_id="wallet-id",
    permit_id=permit.permit_id,
    idempotency_key="invoke-01",
)
```

## Pricing

No public pricing, free-credit grant, uptime SLA, or compliance commitment is
currently offered. This submission describes a controlled design-partner
pilot.
