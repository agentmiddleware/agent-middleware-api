# Failure Semantics — when a metered call dies mid-flight

A governed tool call can fail before the debit, after the debit, during the
upstream dispatch, after the upstream executed, or while the result is being
committed — and a process crash can interrupt any of those. This document
defines the terminal outcome for every one of those cases: what the caller is
told, whether the wallet ends up charged, whether the tool may have executed,
and which test proves it.

Like [PROOF_MATRIX.md](PROOF_MATRIX.md), this is descriptive, not aspirational.
Each row names its proving tests, and the last section lists what is deliberately
**not** claimed. For the claims the project never makes, see
[SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md](../SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md).

## The invariant

Every governed invocation that terminalizes or is reconcilable ends in
**exactly one signed terminal accounting**: an Ed25519-signed receipt (plus a
chain-hashed audit event) stating the outcome and the net charge. A local
post-effect crash is the explicit exception: it remains in manual review with
no receipt and no automatic redispatch.
Money only moves next to a durable record that a reconciler can later
compensate:

1. Budget reservation and the durable dispatch-attempt row are written in
   **one transaction** (`authorize_reserve_and_prepare`,
   `app/services/mcp_dispatch_attempts.py`) — a failed transaction leaves
   neither.
2. The **debit strictly precedes dispatch**, is keyed to the idempotency
   record (`operation_key`), and is linked to the attempt before the upstream
   call starts (`_charge_and_checkpoint`, `app/routers/mcp.py`).
3. A durable, one-shot **dispatch claim** (`claim_dispatch`) is committed
   immediately before the network send. The transition stores
   `state = dispatch_claimed` plus one nullable `dispatch_claim_hash`; the raw
   process-local claim is not persisted. Only the still-live activation that
   created that hash may recover a lost commit acknowledgement. Every later
   activation must fail closed without sending.

The dispatch attempt is a small state machine — `prepared → dispatch_claimed →
{succeeded, returned_error, delivery_uncertain, response_rejected}`, with
`prepared → returned_error` as the only pre-dispatch terminal. Terminal states
are absorbing. Historical `dispatched` rows have a null claim hash and remain
classified as already sent; they are never claimable again.

## Terminal outcomes

| Outcome | Trigger | Wallet | Gateway observation | HTTP / JSON-RPC | Proven by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `success` | Tool returned a valid result; receipt committed | **Charged** | A valid response reached the gateway; the downstream effect is not independently proven | 200 | `test_governed_mcp_invoke_returns_receipt_and_replay_does_not_double_charge`, `test_governed_upstream_success_replays_without_second_debit_or_dispatch` |
| `denied` | Permit, wallet-policy, recipient-domain, or human-approval denial — all evaluated **before money moves** | Never debited; reservation released | No gateway dispatch | 403 / `-32003` | `test_frozen_wallet_denial_returns_receipt_and_replays_without_charge`, `test_out_of_scope_governed_mcp_denial_returns_receipt`, `test_rejected_approval_is_terminal_and_replays`, `test_upstream_permit_denials_never_charge_or_dispatch` |
| `insufficient_funds` | The charge itself was refused (balance, child-wallet cap, daily limit) | Never debited; reservation released | No gateway dispatch | 402 / `-32004` | `test_insufficient_funds_returns_receipt_and_replays_without_charge` |
| `failed_refunded` | A **confirmed** failure: local tool raised; upstream returned `isError: true`; DNS/TLS/`initialize` failed before the remote dispatch claim; charge refused on the upstream path; or a crash before dispatch, finalized by the reconciler | Debit refunded (or never taken). The receipt signs `credits_charged = 0`; the ledger separately proves the correlated refund | An `isError` response may have reached the gateway; pre-claim cases were not dispatched; no downstream effect is independently proven | 500 or 502 / `-32006` (402/403 for refused charges) | Pre-claim failure, guarded completion, and reconciliation tests in `tests/test_mcp_upstream_governed.py`, `tests/test_mcp_dispatch_router_claim.py`, and `tests/test_mcp_dispatch_reconciliation.py` |
| `delivery_uncertain` | The one-shot remote dispatch claim was committed, then a timeout, transport failure, or process death left the outcome unknowable | **Stays charged.** Never redispatched | **Unknown** — that is the definition | 504 / `-32005` | Stale-claim reconciliation and PostgreSQL process-kill cases |
| `response_rejected` | The upstream **did** respond, but the response is unusable: invalid shape, reflected bearer token, non-serializable, or over the byte cap (wire-level or at persistence) | **Stays charged** | A response reached the gateway; the downstream effect is not independently proven | 502 / `-32006` | `test_confirmed_result_rejected_by_persistence_is_terminal_and_replayable`, `test_terminal_response_rejected_retains_charge_and_is_replayable` |
| `failed_unrefunded` | A refund was owed and the refund **itself** failed | Charged; a durable operator work item is created atomically with the receipt | Depends on the underlying failure | 500 / `-32603` | `test_governed_refund_failure_keeps_permit_budget_reserved`, `test_refund_reconciliation_retries_exactly_once_and_preserves_agent_replay` |

Requests rejected before a valid permit and an executable tool are established
(unknown tool, `permit_required`, `permit_not_found`) terminate with a signed
terminal *idempotency record* but no receipt — there is no authority to bill
against. The README states this limit; the replay still returns the original
envelope.

## Why `delivery_uncertain` cannot be "fixed"

The durable dispatch claim is written immediately before the network
send (`before_dispatch` in `app/services/upstream_mcp.py`). Every failure
**before** that claim is provably non-delivered, so it is safe to refund
and sign `failed_refunded`. Every failure **after** it is inherently
ambiguous: the upstream may or may not have executed, and no amount of gateway
logic can find out. The design response is to *preserve the ambiguity
honestly* rather than guess:

- the debit is retained and the receipt says so;
- the server **never redispatches** — the HTTP transport is built with
  `retries=0`, the adapter invokes the tool exactly once, the claim transition
  permits only one activation, terminal states are absorbing, and the
  reconciler imports no executor at all;
- resolution belongs to the caller and the upstream provider, using the
  forwarded idempotency metadata (below) and the signed evidence.

Retaining the charge is a deliberate incentive choice: an ambiguous call that
auto-refunded would pay callers to induce timeouts against providers whose
side effects completed.

## Crash windows

A worker process can die at any point in the sequence. The reconciler
(`app/services/mcp_dispatch_reconciliation.py`) finalizes what the crash left
behind — "without ever redispatching", per its own docstring. Faults are
injected at each durable boundary in the tests named below.

| Window — process dies… | Detected by | Resolution | Money |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. after debit, before dispatch** (attempt `prepared`) | Stale-active sweep; the debit is found by its `operation_key` even if the crash preceded `attach_charge` | `failed_refunded` (`reconciled_stale_prepared`), signed receipt + audit, replay returns 502 | **Refunded**, budget released |
| **A′. A, proved by an actual process kill** (worker killed the instant the debit commits, before `attach_charge`) | Stale-active sweep, after a real `SIGKILL` across two OS processes | `failed_refunded`; the orphaned debit is adopted by operation identity and the upstream is never contacted | **Refunded** exactly once, budget released |
| **B. after the claim, before a trustworthy response** (attempt `dispatch_claimed`) | Stale-active sweep after the fixed maximum-lifetime idle window | `delivery_uncertain`, signed receipt + audit, replay returns 504; no gateway redispatch | **Stays charged** |
| **B′. B, with a landed remote effect** (attempt still `dispatch_claimed`) | Same stale-active sweep | `delivery_uncertain`; the gateway does not send again, but this record does not prove whether or how many downstream effects occurred | **Stays charged** |
| **C. after the response, before the receipt commit** (attempt terminal, no receipt) | Terminal-without-receipt sweep; the stored canonical result is **re-hashed byte-exact** before reuse (`dispatch_stored_result_hash_mismatch` on any tamper) | The recorded terminal state is adopted and signed; a recorded `returned_error` completes its refund | Per the recorded state |
| **D1. lost COMMIT ack on reserve+prepare** | Recovery re-read adopts only an invariant-identical `prepared` row | Same attempt id returned; no second reservation | Unchanged (`test_lost_commit_ack_recovery_no_double_charge`) |
| **D2. lost COMMIT ack on the dispatch claim** | Only the still-live activation whose generated hash matches the stored `dispatch_claim_hash` may adopt the committed claim | That activation may continue to one send; a fresh caller cannot acquire the claim | **Stays charged** if the claim later becomes ambiguous |
| **D3. lost ack on the final completion** (receipt exists, idempotency record empty) | Receipt-present / response-`NULL` sweep, which runs **before** the generic sweep | The replay record is rebuilt from the signed receipt; an existing `failed_refunded` receipt **blocks** a second budget release | Unchanged |
| **E. before any effect** (no attempt, no debit, no receipt) | Effect-free idempotency sweep | The record is deleted so the same key can genuinely retry. **Governed remote dispatch only** — the sweep is scoped to `operation_kind == "upstream_mcp"`, because a local tool's side-effect ordering is not observable to the reconciler. A local-path crash in the same window is held in progress rather than released, and the key cannot be reused until an operator intervenes. | Nothing ever moved |
| **F. reserved, then died before charging** (budget reserved, no debit) | Permit budget reconciliation, but only once the permit can no longer admit a charge | The reservation is left in place on a still-active permit: a long-running call is indistinguishable from a dead one, so reclaiming early could let a concurrent request over-spend. It is reclaimed when the permit is revoked or expires. | **Nothing charged**; the agent can spend less than authorized, never more |

The established pre-claim and terminal recovery behavior is covered by
`tests/test_mcp_dispatch_reconciliation.py` (including
`test_crash_between_debit_and_dispatch_reconciles_refund`,
`test_kill_between_dispatch_and_response_becomes_delivery_uncertain`,
`test_terminal_success_is_reconstructed_from_bounded_result`,
`test_existing_receipt_missing_idempotency_completion_replays_full_result`,
`test_effect_free_stale_mcp_identity_is_released_for_safe_retry`) and by the
multi-process kill tests in `tests/test_mcp_postgres_multiprocess.py` — of
which `test_kill_after_dispatch_checkpoint_is_charged_delivery_uncertain` and
`test_kill_after_remote_effect_never_redispatches_the_effect` cover window B by
killing a real worker on either side of the remote effect, and
`test_kill_between_debit_and_dispatch_refunds_without_dispatching` covers
window A the same way, rather than by seeding the durable state in process.

Focused state-machine and reconciliation tests cover the `dispatch_claimed`
transition, hash ownership after a lost commit acknowledgement, claim
contention, and the fixed stale window. The PostgreSQL process-kill harness
covers the durable claim boundaries across independent workers.

A claim becomes eligible after the fixed 11,430-second idle threshold: enough
for the maximum supported 600-second connection timeout, three maximum
3,600-second call phases, and cleanup margin. It is processed by the next
five-minute sweep, so nominal pickup can take about 11,730 seconds, plus any
bounded-batch backlog. Using the global ceiling instead of each worker's
current settings prevents a rollout with shorter timeouts from declaring an
older worker's valid long-running call stale.

Reconciliation itself is idempotent by construction: audit event ids are
derived deterministically from the attempt id, refunds are keyed
`refund-{ledger_entry_id}`, budget release is exactly-once, and receipts are
unique per idempotency record — so two reconcilers racing produce one receipt
and one audit event
(`test_concurrent_dispatch_reconcilers_create_one_signed_audit_in_postgres`),
and a repeated sweep repairs zero rows. Crash-recovered receipts sign the
same permit-constraint snapshot bytes a live receipt would
(`test_reconciler_constraints_snapshot_matches_live_path`).

## The replay contract

A completed or terminalized invocation replays its stored envelope without
re-execution or a second charge, including the original receipt where one
exists. An unfinished local manual-review record instead remains
`idempotency_in_progress` and has no receipt. Replay access re-validates the
permit↔wallet↔key binding first, so a revoked permit or a different key cannot
read the stored receipt.

| Stored terminal state | Replay returns |
|---|---|
| `success` | 200 with the stored result and the same `receipt_id` |
| `denied` | 403 / `-32003`, original reason and receipt |
| `insufficient_funds` | 402 / `-32004` |
| `failed_refunded` | 500/502 with the upstream error detail where recorded |
| `delivery_uncertain` | 504 / `-32005`, with the dispatch attempt reference |
| `response_rejected` | 502 / `-32006` |
| `failed_unrefunded` | 500 with the reconciliation status — a stored claim of `resolved` is **re-validated against the ledger on every replay** and rejected if unsubstantiated |

Two non-terminal answers matter to clients:

- **`idempotency_in_progress`** — another request holds this key with no
  terminal result yet. Upstream calls wait a bounded window for the winner;
  local calls answer immediately. Retry the **same** key; do not mint a new
  one, because the original may already have had a side effect.
  The claim fence also uses this response for an uncertain
  preparation commit and for a losing dispatch claimant. That is an observable
  correction from the earlier generic upstream-prepare failure on the rare
  uncertain-commit path. REST preserves the existing `400` response and
  JSON-RPC preserves the existing `-32003` code.
- **`idempotency_key_reused`** — the same key arrived with a *different*
  logical payload. Fail-closed; nothing is dispatched or charged
  (`test_governed_upstream_conflicting_payload_reuse_never_redispatches`).

The idempotency identity is the *logical* call — transport-independent, so a
JSON-RPC call and its REST retry share one identity
(`test_governed_upstream_replays_across_jsonrpc_and_rest_transport`).

## What counts as a key

A client-supplied key is honored exactly as sent, and only when it is usable:
a JSON string with at least one non-whitespace character, at most 128
characters (the width of the durable `idempotency_records.idempotency_key`
column; the Python SDK enforces the same bound before sending), and no control
characters. The gateway never strips, truncates, stringifies, or regenerates a
key on the caller's behalf, so two distinct valid keys stay two distinct keys.

A key that is **present but unusable** — the wrong JSON type, blank, too long,
carrying control characters, or supplied in two sources (`Idempotency-Key`
header and body) that disagree — is refused with invalid params (JSON-RPC
`-32602`, REST `400`) and a machine-readable
`reason_code` (`idempotency_key_not_a_string`, `idempotency_key_blank`,
`idempotency_key_too_long`, `idempotency_key_control_characters`,
`idempotency_key_not_utf8`, `idempotency_key_conflict`). The refusal happens before a permit is minted,
anything is reserved or charged, or anything is dispatched. Substituting a
generated key there would silently defeat the retry protection the caller
asked for: every retry carrying the same malformed key would become a new
charged operation (`test_mcp_idempotency_key_validation`).

Only a genuinely **absent** key — no header, no body entry, or a JSON `null`
entry — is treated as an un-keyed call. On the standard MCP endpoint that means
a generated key, and every un-keyed call, retries included, is a new charged
operation. Clients that retry must always send their own persistent key; a
governed `/mcp/messages` call without one is refused with
`idempotency_key_required`.

The governed AWI HTTP routes — `POST /v1/awi/execute`,
`/v1/awi/passkey/challenge`, `/v1/awi/passkey/verify`, `/v1/awi/dom/sync`,
`/v1/awi/rag/index`, and `/v1/awi/rag/query` — hold their `Idempotency-Key`
header to this same contract. There the key is mandatory: no header at all is
HTTP 400 `idempotency_key_required`, and a header that is present but unusable
(blank, over 128 characters, control characters, or repeated lines that name
different keys) is HTTP 400 `invalid_idempotency_key` with the same
`reason_code`, `source`, and `remediation` fields plus the governed `tool`,
refused before the permit is validated and before any idempotency record
exists. The stored identity is the header value exactly as received — it is
not trimmed, so `' k'` and `'k'` are two different keys
(`test_awi_http_governance`).

Two details of *where* a key is read: on `POST /mcp` the body sources are
`params._meta["io.agentmiddleware/idempotency_key"]` and, for a client written
against the legacy transport, `params.mcpContext.idempotency_key` (the rest of
that object is ignored there; the endpoint mints its own permit), and a
`mcpContext` that is not an object is `-32602`. An `Idempotency-Key` header,
on every surface that reads one, is decoded as UTF-8 and nothing else: a
non-ASCII key sent in the header equals the same key sent in the body instead
of being read as latin-1 mojibake, and bytes that are not valid UTF-8 are
refused (`idempotency_key_not_utf8`) rather than read as latin-1, so two
different wire values can never alias to one stored key
(`test_mcp_transport_hardening`).

Before any key is read, both transports refuse a body the reply could not
carry: JSON that only Python's parser accepts (`NaN`, `Infinity`, an
overflowing number, a lone-surrogate escape) would execute, debit, and then
fail to answer, and a body nested deeper than 100 levels would hit the
parser's recursion limit. `POST /mcp/messages` answers every such body, and a
non-UTF-8 one, as HTTP 400 `Invalid JSON`. `POST /mcp` answers an unechoable
body with `-32600` and non-UTF-8 bytes with `-32700` (both HTTP 400), and an
over-nested body with `-32602`; a plain syntax error is the SDK's own
`-32700`. No permit, record, debit, or dispatch exists for any of them
(`test_mcp_legacy_envelope_validation`, `test_standard_mcp_endpoint`).

## Exactly-once refunds

`failed_refunded` means the correlated refund is already durable — the receipt
signs a net charge of zero, and the evidence layer independently requires the
refund ledger row to exist. When the refund itself fails, the system does not
pretend: it signs `failed_unrefunded` **atomically with** a durable
reconciliation work item, and an operator (bootstrap-admin only) retries it
later. That retry is exactly-once under concurrency: the refund entry id is
the deterministic `refund-{ledger_entry_id}`, so even a refund whose commit
ack was lost is recognized rather than duplicated
(`test_lost_refund_ack_releases_budget_without_double_refund`,
`test_concurrent_refund_reconciliation_is_exactly_once_in_postgres`). A forged
`resolved` claim without the matching ledger row fails closed on every read
and replay (`test_forged_resolved_reconciliation_without_refund_fails_closed`).

## What this deliberately does not claim

1. **Post-dispatch ambiguity is never resolved automatically.** No retry, no
   probabilistic refund. The charge stands, the receipt says
   `delivery_uncertain`, and reconciliation with the upstream is the caller's
   and operator's job.
2. **Remote exactly-once and downstream-effect proof are not claimed.** The gateway forwards
   `io.agentmiddleware/invocation_id` and `io.agentmiddleware/idempotency_key`
   in the MCP call metadata; a remote side effect is exactly-once only if the
   upstream honors them. `dispatch_claimed` proves only that the gateway
   committed its one-shot send authority, not that the effect happened.
3. **Crashed reservations on still-live permits are not reclaimed early.** A
   long-running call and a crashed one are indistinguishable from outside, so
   the reservation is conservatively held until the permit expires.
4. **A local tool's post-side-effect crash goes to operator review, not
   recovery.** With no persisted response there is nothing safe to
   reconstruct; the row is counted for review and the replay stays
   in-progress (`test_post_side_effect_crash_requires_review_without_redispatch`).
5. **There is a blind window after a crash.** A claim is eligible only after
   the fixed 11,430-second idle window and is picked up by the next five-minute
   sweep, in bounded batches; nominal pickup can therefore take about 11,730
   seconds plus backlog. Backlog is surfaced in
   `/health/dependencies` and the operator dispatch summary rather than hidden.
6. **Crash proofs are boundary-instrumented.** Faults are injected at the
   durable commit points listed above — not at arbitrary instructions, not
   database failover, not multi-node HA (see PROOF_MATRIX).
7. **Cross-process correctness is PostgreSQL's row locks.** The SQLite test
   path adds a process-local lock for determinism; it is not the
   correctness boundary.
8. **The durable claim and send-state transitions are remote-only.** The
   supporting operation-keyed billing transaction fence is shared by other
   callers, but this slice does not change local-tool reservations, per-tool
   call slots, quotes, human approvals, API-key/JWT authentication, or rate
   limiting.
