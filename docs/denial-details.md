# Denial reason codes and details (a refusal an agent can act on)

**Audience:** partner integrators and agent authors.

A governed denial used to be a bare reason string. `permit_budget_exceeded`
tells an agent that it failed; it does not tell it whether to ask for two more
credits or two hundred, so the only available move is to retry and fail again.

Permit-validation denials carry a `details` object naming the constraint that
was evaluated and the numbers behind it. When a governed MCP call with a bound
permit reaches a terminal non-success state, new receipts also carry a nullable
`reason_code`.

`reason_code` is part of the receipt's signed payload. It survives portable
export and is available in the verified `claims` returned by
`b2a_sdk.receipt_verifier`; the human-readable `b2a-verify-receipt` output
prints it as `reason`. This makes the denial category independently verifiable
without treating the richer diagnostic context as a signed claim.

Legacy receipts may omit `reason_code` and still verify. Successful receipts
omit it. Consumers must therefore treat the field as optional.

## Where it appears

| Surface | Shape |
|---------|-------|
| `POST /mcp/tools/{id}/invoke` | `403 {"detail": {"error": ..., "receipt": {...}, "details": {...}}}` |
| `POST /mcp/messages` (JSON-RPC) | `error.data.details`, beside `error.data.receipt` |
| `POST /v1/permits/verify` | `details` alongside `valid` and `reason` (absent when valid) |
| Governed AWI actions | `detail.details` |
| Signed audit metadata | `denial_details` on the denial's audit event |
| Portable receipt | signed `reason_code` inside `signing_input` when present |

The portable receipt signature authenticates `reason_code`, not the adjacent
`details` object. Details remain API and audit context beside the receipt,
never instead of it.

### `verify` needs the action, not just the permit

`POST /v1/permits/verify` decides an *action*: it answers "would this wallet,
calling this tool, at this price, be admitted under this permit?" Send
`wallet_id` and `tool` (and `estimated_credits` when the price matters) or the
verdict is not about the call you meant. A request omitting either gets
`valid: false` with reason `permit_verify_context_missing` and
`details.missing` naming the absent fields — not a binding reason, which would
read as "this permit is not yours" to the permit's own subject. Reasons that do
not depend on the missing context (`permit_not_found`, `permit_expired`,
`permit_revoked`) are still reported as themselves.

## Reason-code and remediation catalog

This is the authoritative catalog for the `reason_code` values emitted by the
current governed MCP receipt paths. It excludes errors that happen before a
receipt can be created, such as a missing permit, quote failure, or idempotency
conflict. The signed reason names the failure class; use the signed `outcome`
and credit fields to determine whether a debit was retained, refunded, or never
made. API details and audit metadata remain adjacent context, not receipt-signed
claims.

### Permit and recipient binding

A non-active permit uses `permit_<status>`; `permit_revoked` is the normal
revocation case.

| Reason code | Details | Remediation |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `permit_budget_exceeded` | `required_credits`, `remaining_credits`, `spent_credits`, `max_credits` | Request a permit with enough remaining credits, then retry with a new idempotency key. |
| `permit_aggregate_value_cap_exceeded` | `required_credits`, `charged_to_date`, `aggregate_value_cap` | Request a higher aggregate cap or a replacement permit. |
| `permit_max_calls_exceeded` | `tool`, `limit`, `calls_made` | Request a replacement permit with a higher per-tool call limit. |
| `permit_constraint_unsupported_for_upstream` | `execution_backend`, `unsupported_constraints` | Request a replacement permit that omits the listed remote-unsupported constraints and uses `max_credits` as the atomic ceiling, then invoke with a new idempotency key. Replaying the denied key returns the stored denial. |
| `permit_tool_not_allowed` | `requested_tool`, `allowed_tools` | Use an allowed tool or request a permit that names the requested tool. |
| `permit_scope_missing` | `required_scopes`, `missing_scopes` | Request a permit containing every listed missing scope. |
| `permit_expired` | `expired_at`, `checked_at` | Request a new, unexpired permit; do not retry the expired one. |
| `permit_<status>` (normally `permit_revoked`) | `status`, `revoked_at` | Request a new active permit from the issuer. |
| `permit_forbidden_field` | `field`, `forbidden_fields` | Remove the forbidden field and its value, or request a permit that allows it. |
| `permit_signature_invalid` | `key_id` | Obtain a freshly issued permit signed by an active trusted key. |
| `permit_wallet_mismatch` / `permit_key_mismatch` | `bound_to` only — no values | Authenticate as the permit subject or request a permit bound to the current wallet and key. |
| `permit_recipient_domain_mismatch` | No diagnostic values in the portable receipt | Use the permit's bound upstream domain or request a permit bound to the intended recipient. |
| `permit_denied` | No stable diagnostic details | Inspect the adjacent audit event and replace the permit; this is the fail-closed fallback when validation supplies no narrower reason. |

Credit amounts are exact decimal strings, not floats. Timestamps are explicit
UTC (`...Z`).

For forbidden-field denials, the API response reason may be
`permit_forbidden_field:<name>`. The portable receipt normalizes that dynamic
value to the signed, stable `permit_forbidden_field` reason code because field
names are not constrained to the receipt's safe machine-code grammar. The
adjacent `details.field` value identifies the rejected field.

### Wallet and standing policy

| Reason code | Meaning | Remediation |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `wallet_frozen` | The wallet is frozen and cannot be debited. | Resolve the freeze with an administrator; retry with a new idempotency key only after the wallet is spendable. |
| `wallet_expired` | The child wallet's spending lifetime has ended. | Use a non-expired wallet and a permit bound to it. |
| `insufficient_funds` | Balance or a wallet spending cap cannot cover the action. | Top up the wallet, reduce the action cost, or change the applicable cap, then use a new idempotency key. |
| `human_approval_required` | An active wallet policy demands a human decision and the invoke's permit has no approval gate to provide one. | Invoke under a permit minted with `requires_human_approval` (the standard `/mcp` surface mints one automatically when policy demands it), or have an administrator revise the policy. A gated permit satisfies only this constraint — the policy's other limits still apply. |
| `tool_not_allowed` | A wallet policy excludes the requested tool. | Use a policy-allowed tool or update the policy allowlist. |
| `service_category_not_allowed` | A wallet policy excludes the tool's service category. | Use an allowed category or update the category allowlist. |
| `max_cost_per_action_exceeded` | The quoted action cost exceeds the wallet policy's per-action limit. | Lower the action cost or raise the policy limit. |
| `daily_spend_limit_exceeded` | Current daily spend plus this action exceeds the wallet policy limit. | Wait for the policy window to reset or have an administrator change the limit. |
| `real_effects_required` | The policy forbids a simulated execution path. | Use a real-effects tool configuration or revise the policy. |
| `policy_denied` | Policy evaluation denied without a narrower stable reason. | Inspect the adjacent audit policy ID and evaluated constraints, then correct the blocking policy. |

### Terminal human approval

| Reason code | Meaning | Remediation |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `human_approval_not_configured` | The permit requires approval, but the production approval service is not safely configured. | Configure Sentinel and approvers, then start a new invocation; do not enable simulated approval in production. |
| `human_approval_request_mismatch` | The stored approval is bound to different tool arguments or cost. | Start a new invocation and approval with a new idempotency key for the exact request. |
| `human_approval_request_rejected` | Sentinel rejected approval creation as a terminal client/configuration error. | Correct Sentinel credentials, approvers, or request configuration, then start a new invocation. |
| `human_approval_rejected` | A human rejected the action. | Do not retry automatically; change the action or obtain a new explicit approval. |
| `human_approval_expired` | The approval window elapsed before use. | Start a new invocation and obtain a fresh approval. |
| `human_approval_consumed` | The single-use approval already authorized another invocation. | Start a new invocation with a new idempotency key and approval. |

`human_approval_pending` and `human_approval_unavailable` are deliberately not
receipt reason codes. They are retryable API states: no receipt is created,
nothing is charged, and the in-progress idempotency record is abandoned so the
same request body and idempotency key can be retried when approval is decided
or Sentinel recovers.

### Dispatch, tool execution, and refund

| Reason code | Meaning | Remediation |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `upstream_prepare_failed` | Atomic authorization/dispatch preparation failed before an upstream call could start. | Repair the gateway or database preparation failure, then retry with a new idempotency key. |
| `upstream_pre_dispatch_failed` | Charging or checkpointing failed before confirmed upstream dispatch; any discovered debit was refunded. | Fix the gateway or upstream configuration, then retry with a new idempotency key. |
| `upstream_returned_error` | The upstream MCP server returned a tool error and the debit was refunded. | Inspect the adjacent upstream result, fix the request or server, then retry with a new key. |
| `response_rejected` | The upstream response was invalid or too large to retain; the dispatch occurred and the charge is retained. | Inspect dispatch/audit context and fix the response contract or size limit; do not retry automatically. |
| `delivery_uncertain` | Dispatch may have occurred, but the terminal result is unknown; the charge is retained. | Reconcile with the upstream invocation ID before considering any retry. |
| `tool_execution_failed` | A local registered tool raised and the debit was refunded. | Fix the tool or arguments, then retry with a new idempotency key. |
| `refund_failed` | The tool/dispatch failed and its debit could not be refunded; an operator work item is pending. | Do not retry the action; complete and verify refund reconciliation first. |
| `failed_refunded` | Reconciliation finalized a stale prepared or otherwise confirmed failure and compensated any debit. | Inspect adjacent dispatch error/audit context for the underlying cause; use a new key only for an intentional retry. |

For `refund_failed`, the API error names the tool's own error after the
reason (`refund_failed; tool_error:…` for a local tool,
`refund_failed; upstream_error:…` for a configured upstream tool) and may
append `audit_failed`. The refund store's and audit store's own text never
travels: it is kept in the server log and the linked audit event. The
portable receipt signs only the stable `refund_failed` reason; refund
reconciliation state remains adjacent API/audit context.

## What details deliberately do not say

**Binding mismatches carry no values.** A caller that presents a permit bound
to a different wallet or key has not proved it is the subject, so the denial
names the binding that failed (`{"bound_to": "subject_wallet_id"}`) and nothing
about which wallet or key the permit actually belongs to. Everything else in
the table describes the caller's *own* permit, which it can already read at
`GET /v1/permits/{permit_id}`.

**Forbidden fields echo the name, never the value.** The value is the thing the
permit forbade carrying.

Reading a denial still requires being authorized for the permit: a foreign
wallet key is refused at `POST /v1/permits/verify` (403) before any verdict is
computed. Details enrich a refusal you were already entitled to see; they do
not widen who can ask.

## Example

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "error": "permit_budget_exceeded",
    "receipt": { "outcome": "denied", "...": "..." },
    "details": {
      "required_credits": "5.0",
      "remaining_credits": "3",
      "spent_credits": "0",
      "max_credits": "3"
    }
  }
}
```

An agent reading that can request a permit for the amount it actually needs —
or, if a human must approve the increase,
[ask for one](permit-requests.md) with the number already in hand.

After exporting the receipt, an operator can verify and display the signed
reason without calling the gateway:

```text
$ b2a-verify-receipt --bundle receipt.json --keys trust-keys.json
VERIFIED  rcpt-example
  signed by   key-example
  permit      permit-example
  tool        partner.echo
  outcome     denied
  reason      permit_budget_exceeded
  credits     0 charged of 5 authorized
  at          2026-08-11T00:00:00Z
```
