# Credentialing an agent to test this platform

An agent asked to validate the trust plane hits a wall at the economic
invariants: `discover → authenticate` are open, but `authorize → invoke →
meter → receipt` all require a wallet-scoped API key, and production
deliberately has no anonymous signup, no public key minting, and no free
credit grant. That gate is correct and must stay. This document is the
supported way around it: the agent credentials itself against a **local**
instance running the same code, and proves the invariants there.

What that does and does not establish is stated plainly at the bottom.

## 1. Start a local instance with self-provisioning on

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir -p data
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these in `.env` (generate a fresh signing seed; never reuse one):

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=local
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/local_api.db
ENABLE_DEV_KEY_SELF_PROVISION=true   # mints wallet-scoped keys, no shared secret
ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL=true             # registers partner.notes.write
ENABLE_DOGFOOD_SECOND_TOOL=true      # registers partner.notes.count (scope-denial target)
TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64=$(python3 -c 'import base64,secrets; print(base64.b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode())')
TRUST_SIGNING_KEY_ID=local-dev-ed25519
```

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Startup must log `trust_signing_key_ready`. Without a seed the app refuses
to boot — trust mode has no unsigned fallback.

## 2. Let the agent mint its own credential

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/dev-keys/self-provision \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"agent_id": "my-agent"}'
```

This returns a sponsor wallet, an agent wallet funded with synthetic dev
credits, and a **wallet-scoped** key (shown once) — the same credential
class `scripts/partner_api_key_bootstrap.py` produces for a partner, so the
agent exercises the real permit/metering/receipt path rather than a special
one. It is never bootstrap-admin: it cannot read the audit plane or reach
another tenant's wallet. Call it from a CLI or SDK — a cross-origin `Origin`
header is refused, because the route is unauthenticated and returns a live
secret.

## 3. Run the invariant proof

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/agent_self_credential_proof.py
```

The harness self-provisions, issues a permit scoped to one tool, and checks
the claims that carry economic weight, exiting non-zero on any failure:

| # | Invariant | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | charge-once | one governed invoke → exactly one debit |
| 2 | replay | same idempotency key → cached receipt, no new debit, no second side effect |
| 3 | concurrency | 5 identical in-flight calls → one success, one debit, one side effect |
| 4 | reuse-conflict | same key, different body → 400, no debit |
| 5 | scope-denial | tool outside the permit → 403 `permit_tool_not_allowed`, signed denial receipt, zero charged |
| 6 | no-permit | governed tool without a permit → 403, no debit |
| 7 | signature | every receipt verifies under the published Ed25519 key; tampered copies do not |

Check 7 is a genuinely independent verification: it fetches the public key
from `/.well-known/trust-keys.json`, verifies the portable receipt's
`signing_input` with its own Ed25519 code, and then re-signs nothing —
it mutates `credits_charged`, `outcome`, `tool`, and `wallet_id` in turn and
requires each forgery to fail. A field already equal to the mutation value
is skipped, so no check can pass vacuously.

Two behaviors worth knowing before you read the output as a bug:

- Under true concurrency the losing callers get **400**, not a replayed 200.
  The gateway fails closed while the first call is in flight; the cached
  receipt is served on retry once the winner settles.
- A denial still mints a **signed receipt** with `credits_charged` 0. Denials
  are evidence, not silence.

## 4. What this proves — and what it does not

Proven against this code: for one accepted idempotency key, at most one
gateway authorization and at most one debit under replay, concurrency,
conflict, and denial, with a signed receipt on every path that finalizes or
is denied; and that receipts are tamper-evident under the published key.

Not proven by this harness, and not claimed:

- **Production behavior.** Same code, different infrastructure (Postgres,
  Redis, a real upstream MCP server). A local pass is strong evidence about
  the logic, not a measurement of the production deployment.
- **Remote exactly-once.** The gateway guarantees *at most* one
  authorization and *at most* one debit per accepted key — "exactly-once" is
  the deduplication term, never a duplicate charge, not always a charge. A
  remote side effect is exactly-once only if the upstream honors the
  forwarded idempotency key — the OpenAPI contract narrows the claim to
  exactly that, correctly.
- **A receipt on every finalized path, not on every charged call.** If the
  audit event or receipt write is lost to contention *after* the call has run
  and the wallet has moved, the call answers `manual_review_required` with
  committed effects and no receipt, and the record is held for an operator;
  retrying it under a fresh key would run and charge it again. The local
  harness does not drive that window. See
  [failure-semantics.md § When no terminal accounting can be written](failure-semantics.md#when-no-terminal-accounting-can-be-written).
- **The local tool is simulated.** `partner.notes.write` appends to a local
  JSONL file and is labeled `simulation: true` in discovery. Production's
  `partner.echo` is a real upstream call. Authorization, metering, and
  receipting are the same code on both; execution is not. Only the
  configured upstream tool has the durable dispatch state machine that
  receipts an ambiguous post-send outcome as `delivery_uncertain`. A local
  governed tool has no dispatch record and fails closed into manual review
  instead, so a local pass does not exercise the upstream crash semantics.

To reproduce the invariants against production, an operator must issue a
wallet-scoped key and funded permit out of band. No agent should manufacture
production credentials, and this surface cannot: production-like
environments refuse to boot with `ENABLE_DEV_KEY_SELF_PROVISION` set, and
the handler independently returns 403 there.
