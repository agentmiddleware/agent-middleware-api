# Railway IaC and deploy SOP

**Audience:** operators deploying the trust-plane API.  
**Product lens:** [`WEDGE.md`](../WEDGE.md) + [`SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md`](../SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md).

## Managed single-tenant compliance-evidence pilot

The supported enterprise pilot is vendor-managed single-tenant. Each customer
gets a separate Railway Enterprise project containing exactly one API service,
one PostgreSQL service, and one Redis service, plus a unique public domain,
administrator set, Ed25519 signing seed and key id, and upstream MCP bearer
token. A customer also gets a dedicated Sentinel tenant/key when the optional
Sentinel-backed human-approval integration is enabled. Do not reuse
infrastructure, credentials, signing material, or administrators between
customers. Shared SaaS and customer-VPC deployments are not part of this
pilot. Provision through the manual `railway up` path below; do not add
Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, or other pilot orchestration infrastructure.

Keep PostgreSQL and Redis on Railway private networking and expose only the
FastAPI gateway. During qualification, verify in the Railway control plane
that neither data service has a public domain or TCP proxy and that the API's
runtime connection variables resolve to the private services. The optional
off-platform `--public-db` check requires public database exposure; do not use
that mode as evidence of a qualified private pilot deployment. Run schema
parity inside the deployed API container with `railway ssh` and its private
`DATABASE_URL` instead. `railway run` executes locally with injected variables
and therefore cannot resolve a private-only Railway database hostname.

Configure exactly one real public HTTPS MCP upstream and keep
`ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=false` and `ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL=false`. `site/proof/`
is self-issued public demo material only; never publish customer evidence
there or describe it as an enterprise compliance dashboard.

This release is an agent governance and audit-evidence pilot, not a SOC 2,
HIPAA, PCI, or regulatory-compliance platform. Accept only synthetic or
redacted, low-sensitivity workloads: no PHI, PCI data, regulated production
records, secrets, or sensitive tool arguments. Arguments sent to Sentinel must
also be synthetic or redacted. The signing seed remains a customer-specific
Railway secret and is not KMS/HSM-backed custody.

Durable permits, reservations, bounded replay/results, receipts, approvals,
and audit records remain in that customer's PostgreSQL service. Do not export
them to a shared customer data store for this pilot.

Before onboarding a customer, enable provider backups and complete one
successful restore drill for that customer's PostgreSQL service. Prefer a
Railway PITR restore, which creates a sibling PostgreSQL service and leaves the
source online. An ordinary Railway volume-backup restore instead swaps the
source service to the restored volume and removes backups newer than the
selected point; use that mode only on a non-customer qualification stack or in
an approved maintenance window. Record the date, source backup, restore mode,
verification result, and operator without putting data or credentials in the
record. Make no SLA, RTO, or RPO claim until the corresponding behavior has
been measured and contractually approved.

## Railway configuration and application releases

Railway configuration and application code have separate owners and separate
commands:

- [`.railway/railway.ts`](../.railway/railway.ts) is the project-level IaC
  owner for selected repository-controlled settings on the existing
  `api-service`. Its stable
  `partial = "api-service"` export deliberately excludes PostgreSQL, Redis,
  `partner-mcp-pilot`, volumes, and the PITR bucket.
- `railway config plan` previews the IaC difference. `railway config apply`
  changes Railway configuration after an explicit operator review.
- `railway up` uploads and deploys an application release. It does **not**
  read or apply `.railway/railway.ts`; a successful `railway up` therefore says
  nothing about IaC drift.

Install the pinned SDK without package lifecycle scripts and run the offline
graph check before contacting Railway:

```bash
npm ci --prefix .railway --ignore-scripts
npm test --prefix .railway
```

The tracked graph names every current API environment key as `preserve()`.
Railway still owns each value, including secrets and references to private data
services; the repository owns only the key's continued presence. Add a new live
API key to the IaC file before any plan/apply review. Omitting a live key can
propose its deletion. Never replace `preserve()` with a committed value, and
never use `--show-values` in a plan, terminal capture, CI job, or support log.

Restart policy is deliberately provider-owned: Railway's documented effective
defaults are `ON_FAILURE` with 10 retries. Railway CLI `5.43.3` does not
converge when those defaults are explicit because its current graph omits the
fields. Omitting them removes that known explicit-field false drift and is the
candidate convergent representation. The repaired graph still requires a fresh
disposable plan/apply/second-plan proof before activation; repeat that
validation after any CLI or SDK upgrade before reintroducing either field.
This omission does not authorize an effective restart change; any such plan
delta remains an abort.

### Read-only plan and later activation

An authorized operator may inspect the already-linked project/environment and
request a value-redacted plan:

```bash
railway status --json
railway config plan
```

Do not automate `railway config apply` or `railway config migrate --apply`.
As last operator-verified on 2026-08-29, the first-party production service was
still owned by legacy Config as Code, so a complete production IaC plan remained
blocked until an operator clears that setting. Re-check the linked target and
redacted plan at activation time; do not treat that dated observation as current
state. The live service's stale GitHub source metadata is intentionally not
copied into IaC; disconnecting it is an expected but separately reviewed
activation change, not an incidental migration side effect.

#### Disposable rehearsal

Do not apply the tracked production `.railway/railway.ts` to a disposable
project. It pins the production project name and the
`api.thisisatest.tech` custom domain. Leave that tracked file unchanged and
create an ignored local scratch copy instead:

```bash
cp .railway/railway.ts .railway/rehearsal.ts
```

The `.gitignore` allowlist keeps `.railway/rehearsal.ts` ignored; never force-add
or commit it. In the scratch file, change the project identity to the
disposable project and remove the production custom domain or replace it with
a disposable-only domain. The scratch file must not contain
`api.thisisatest.tech`. Populate only the disposable environment with
synthetic variable values; no production secret, private-service reference, or
customer data may be copied into the rehearsal.

Use a checkout linked only to that disposable project/environment. Inspect
`railway status --json` and stop unless it explicitly identifies the intended
disposable target. Then plan the scratch file by name:

```bash
railway config plan --file .railway/rehearsal.ts
```

Apply the scratch file only after reviewing that plan, re-confirming the linked
disposable project/environment, and confirming that every configured value is
synthetic:

```bash
railway config apply --file .railway/rehearsal.ts
```

Immediately run the second plan against the same scratch graph:

```bash
railway config plan --file .railway/rehearsal.ts --detailed-exit-code
```

Only exit `0` with zero proposed changes counts as a successful rehearsal.
Any proposed change, including any restart-field delta, or any nonzero exit
means the rehearsal failed and blocks production activation. Do not apply
again to accommodate drift.

After a successful disposable rehearsal, a later production activation still
requires an approved maintenance window. Record the current legacy config-file
path plus the previous green application SHA, clear the legacy config-file
setting, and immediately run the production read-only plan above. Abort on any
variable/resource deletion, service creation or service rename, unexpected
domain/placement/restart/build change, unexpected source change, or change to
an unrelated resource. The separately reviewed removal of the stale GitHub
source binding is the only expected production source delta. Before apply,
abort by restoring the recorded legacy config-file setting and stop without
deploying.

Apply only after a named operator approves the complete redacted plan and the
intentional source disconnect. Re-run the plan afterward and require no
unexpected changes. Then deploy the approved exact SHA through the application
release checklist below. After apply, configuration rollback is a separately
reviewed inverse IaC plan; application rollback deploys the previous green SHA
through the same immutable `railway up` sequence. Do not reattach automatic
GitHub deployment as a shortcut, regenerate IaC from live state, or reverse
database migrations as an IaC rollback.

### Dispatch-claim migration and rollback

Migration `037_mcp_dispatch_claim_hash` adds exactly one nullable column,
`mcp_dispatch_attempts.dispatch_claim_hash`. Apply it before application code
that writes the new `dispatch_claimed` state. The nullable shape lets an older
worker continue creating its legacy rows, and the new worker treats a legacy
`dispatched` row as already sent rather than claimable.

Migration 037 **requires a maintenance window**. Process lifetime overlap is
acceptable only while old workers cannot receive new requests and have no
in-flight work:

1. Pause ingress.
2. Fully drain every old worker and in-flight request.
3. Apply migration 037.
4. Deploy the new exact application SHA.
5. Resume traffic only after the new deployment passes its release gates.

An old worker may fail closed if it reads the unknown `dispatch_claimed` state,
but that is not enough for rolling compatibility. Its debit path does not hold
the dispatch-attempt write fence introduced with this migration. An old request
that started from `prepared` can therefore commit a late debit after a new
reconciler has terminalized the attempt as having no debit. The terminal attempt
then rejects attaching that debit, leaving accounting that contradicts the
zero-charge failure evidence. Fully draining old workers is the compatibility
boundary. Do not infer rolling safety from the column being nullable or from an
old worker refusing an unknown state.

An application rollback after the database upgrade must leave migration 037 in
place. Before deploying the previous green application SHA:

1. Pause ingress and drain in-flight requests on the current application.
2. Through the private PostgreSQL connection, require this query to return
   zero:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM mcp_dispatch_attempts
   WHERE state = 'dispatch_claimed';
   ```

3. If any `dispatch_claimed` row remains, abort the rollback. Keep the current
   code available to reconcile or complete it; do not clear its hash, rewrite
   its state, refund it, or redispatch it manually.
4. Only after the count is zero, deploy the previous green exact SHA through
   the same immutable release sequence. Do not run `alembic downgrade` and do
   not drop the nullable column.

Migration 037's downgrade converts any surviving `dispatch_claimed` row to the
older runtime's already-sent `dispatched` state before dropping the hash. That
is a last-resort schema safety property, not the application rollback runbook:
the supported rollback keeps migration 037 in place and drains claims first.

The claim fence is limited to configured remote upstream dispatch. This
migration does not alter local-tool reservations, per-tool call slots, quotes,
human approvals, API-key/JWT authentication, or rate limiting. Its integrated
migration and downgrade paths are covered by focused tests. A production
mixed-worker overlap or rollback drill remains unverified for this release
slice.

## Canonical deploy path

**Build and ship from this repo with the in-repo Dockerfile. Production
releases are operator-run from a clean exact-SHA checkout.**

```bash
# From repository root, linked to the Railway service:
set -euo pipefail
DEPLOY_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
PROJECT_ID="${PROJECT_ID:?set PROJECT_ID to the intended Railway project UUID}"
python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py --railway-source-unbound \
  --railway-project "$PROJECT_ID" --railway-environment production \
  --railway-service api-service
RELEASE_CONTEXT="$(python3 scripts/prepare_railway_release.py --ref "$DEPLOY_SHA")"
test -d "$RELEASE_CONTEXT"
test "$(cat "$RELEASE_CONTEXT/.build_commit_sha")" = "$DEPLOY_SHA"
railway up "$RELEASE_CONTEXT" --path-as-root --no-gitignore \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" --service api-service --environment production --ci
```

The source preflight is read-only: it does not disconnect or mutate the
service provider. Any missing, malformed, ambiguous, repository-bound, or
image-bound provider status stops the release.

That abbreviated command is appropriate only after the pre-deploy gates below.
For a stack that may hold customer data, follow the complete
[private operator release](#private-operator-release-required-for-customer-data)
checklist. GitHub Actions validates the candidate release but deliberately does
not deploy it or hold a Railway SSH key.

`scripts/prepare_railway_release.py` creates a fresh temporary context from
`git archive` at the exact release SHA, then writes that SHA to
`.build_commit_sha`. The Dockerfile requires the staged file, so an unstamped
upload fails during its build rather than after it reaches production.
`/health/dependencies` reports the baked stamp as the true source revision.
Do not set `COMMIT_SHA` or `BUILD_COMMIT_SHA` as Railway service variables:
they are shared mutable configuration and can stamp a concurrent or later
deployment with the wrong SHA.

Local Docker development uses `Dockerfile.dev` through `docker-compose.yml`;
only the production `Dockerfile` requires the immutable stamp. Do not use the
development Dockerfile for a production upload.

`--no-gitignore` is mandatory for the release upload because
`.build_commit_sha` is ignored in normal checkouts. The generated context
contains only the exact `git archive` tree plus that non-secret stamp; never
use `--no-gitignore` against an ordinary working tree.

Railway IaC pins `build.builder = DOCKERFILE` and
`dockerfilePath = Dockerfile`. The command below remains the only supported
production image path for this project, and does not apply IaC.

The repository intentionally does not ship `.env.production` or
`docker-compose.prod.yml`. `.env.example` is the local-development template
and configuration reference, not a production credential file. Production
values belong in Railway service variables or an external secret vault, and
secret files must not be kept in the release checkout.

The canonical public origin for the existing first-party instance is
`https://api.thisisatest.tech`; a customer pilot uses its manifest's unique
domain instead. Railway's
generated `https://api-service-production-433c.up.railway.app` hostname is a
compatibility origin only: keep it reachable for existing integrations, but do
not publish it in customer-facing links, discovery documents, or SDK defaults.

Do **not**:

- Click **Redeploy from GitHub source** in the Railway UI. That can roll the
  service back to an older image / commit than the tree you just verified.
- Treat GHCR `:latest` as the production deploy mechanism. The
  `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` workflow publishes optional tags
  (`sha`, branch, semver, `latest` on default branch) for inspection and
  offline use — **not** as the live Railway ship path.
- Commit secret values (`VALID_API_KEYS`, signing keys, Stripe keys) into
  `.railway/railway.ts` or the git tree. Those names appear only as
  `preserve()` entries in IaC.
- Keep secret files anywhere in the release checkout merely because Git
  ignores them. The Railway upload context is not a credential store; keep
  customer credentials in Railway variables or an external vault only.

If you need a reproducible artifact for air-gapped review, pin a GHCR digest
from a release tag (`ghcr.io/<owner>/agent-middleware-api@sha256:…`). Runtime
deploy remains `railway up` from this Dockerfile.

## Required production variables

Mirror of fail-closed rules in `app.core.trust_mode` and
[`SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md`](../SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md). Set these on the
Railway service (dashboard or `railway variable set`); do **not** put secrets
in committed defaults.

| Variable | Required value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `production` (or other production-like) | Engages trust guardrails. Must be set explicitly: on Railway (detected via the injected `RAILWAY_*` variables) an empty `ENVIRONMENT` refuses to boot rather than silently running with local-compatible defaults |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Empty-key auth bootstrap is forbidden in prod-like |
| `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES` | `false` | Mount only core trust routers + MCP |
| `ENABLE_PUBLIC_MCP_ENDPOINT` | `false` | Anonymous MCP discovery is local-only. Production-like boots **refuse to start** if this is true. Live `api.thisisatest.tech` historically had it on; set it false **before** deploying the Narrow lockdown commit or the new image will not boot. Receipt verification stays on `/.well-known/trust-keys.json`. |
| `ENABLE_STANDARD_MCP_ENDPOINT` | `false` or unset | Auto-minted permits on `POST /mcp`. Do not turn this on. |
| `ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL` | `false` | The simulated `partner.notes.write` tool is local proof infrastructure, not a production integration. The live posture gate fails unless this is explicitly false. |
| `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED` | `true` | Shipped default; keep it |
| `ALLOW_LEGACY_UNPERMITTED_MCP` | `false` | Shipped default; keep it |
| `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` | strict base64 of exactly 32 raw bytes | Required when trust mode is on in prod-like; PEM, hex, 64-byte concatenations, and double-encoded base64 are invalid |
| `TRUST_SIGNING_KEY_ID` | unique customer/environment key id | Must match the non-secret customer manifest; never bind a reused id to new material |
| `STATE_BACKEND` | `postgres` | Use linked Postgres; avoid silent memory fallback |
| `DATABASE_URL` | from Railway Postgres plugin | App normalizes `postgresql://` ↔ `postgresql+asyncpg://` |
| `REDIS_URL` | from the customer's private Railway Redis service | Unique per customer; do not expose Redis publicly |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | public HTTPS API origin | Customer manifest origin; `https://api.thisisatest.tech` only for the existing first-party instance |
| `PUBLIC_CONTACT_NAME` | accountable public person or entity | Launch-gated. Do not use the product name or a placeholder as the accountable identity. |
| `PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | monitored public email address | Launch-gated. This becomes the API/OpenAPI contact only when all public contact fields are valid. |
| `PUBLIC_CONTACT_URL` | working public HTTPS booking URL | Launch-gated. Verify the booking flow manually; do not point this back to the product site. |
| `VALID_API_KEYS` | operator-set secrets | Bootstrap/admin keys only; **never** `change-me` |
| `MCP_UPSTREAM_URL` | one public HTTPS MCP origin | The pilot supports exactly one real upstream tool server |
| `MCP_UPSTREAM_BEARER_TOKEN` | customer-specific secret | Never put it in the manifest or committed files |
| `SENTINEL_API_URL` / `SENTINEL_API_KEY` | Omit unless enabling Sentinel-backed human approval | Optional product integration, not an Agent Middleware release dependency. Approval-required operations fail closed unless both are configured. Send synthetic or redacted arguments only. |
| `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START` | `true` for routine forward-compatible migrations; **not a substitute for migration 037's first-activation maintenance gate** | Entrypoint runs `alembic upgrade head` before uvicorn. App boot then **verifies** trust tables exist and **never** calls `create_all` in production-like envs. Flag + empty `DATABASE_URL` fails closed (container exits). If the DB was previously bootstrapped with `create_all` and has no `alembic_version` row, run `alembic stamp head` once before enabling this flag. Migration 037 must be applied through the paused-ingress, drained-worker sequence above before any new reconciler can receive traffic. |

`REDIS_URL` is required for the managed pilot's isolated Redis service. Outside
that pilot it remains optional when Redis rate limiting is unused; a
production-like service fails closed on Redis outage whenever it is set.
`CORS_ORIGINS` should be locked to known frontends.

Committed `.railway/railway.ts` contains the complete API variable-name set but
no values: every name, including `VALID_API_KEYS`, signing material, and
`RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START`, must map to `preserve()`. Set or rotate values only
in Railway or the approved external vault. Enable migration-on-start only after
confirming Alembic stamp state.

## Applying the Narrow lockdown to the live origin

Do this after the Narrow lockdown commit is on `main`, **before or as** that
commit is deployed to `https://api.thisisatest.tech`. This change does **not**
deploy itself. It does **not** make the GitHub repository private — C.Lee
does that in GitHub.

The live origin was serving anonymous tool catalogs (`/mcp/tools.json`,
`/v1/discover`, `/mcp/tools`) and an unauthenticated `POST /mcp/public` that
listed `partner.echo`. Invoke and key-mint were already closed (401 / 404).
After this commit:

1. **Railway → project `agent-middleware-api` → service `api-service` →
   Variables.** Set `ENABLE_PUBLIC_MCP_ENDPOINT` to `false`. If this stays
   `true`, the new image **will not boot** (`TrustModeGuardrailError`). No
   other new flag is required: production-like boots already require a key
   for tool catalogs.
2. Confirm these stay false or unset: `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES`,
   `ENABLE_DEV_KEY_SELF_PROVISION`, `ENABLE_STANDARD_MCP_ENDPOINT`,
   `DEBUG`, `STATIC_DEV_API_KEYS`. Keep `ENVIRONMENT=production`. Do **not**
   rotate or remove `VALID_API_KEYS` — those are C.Lee's operator keys.
3. **Deploy the merged commit** the same way this service is usually shipped
   (`railway up` from that SHA, or the GitHub → Railway integration if it is
   what currently ships). Do **not** click **Redeploy from GitHub source**
   if that would roll back to an older image. This agent must not run that
   deploy.
4. **Check, from a terminal, with no API key:**
   - `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://api.thisisatest.tech/mcp/tools.json` → `401`
   - `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://api.thisisatest.tech/v1/discover` → `401`
   - `curl -sS -X POST https://api.thisisatest.tech/mcp/public -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}'` → `404`
   - `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://api.thisisatest.tech/.well-known/trust-keys.json` → `200`
   - the same `curl` of `/mcp/tools.json` **with** `X-API-Key: <your operator key>` → `200`
5. **GitHub → this repository → Settings → General → Danger zone → Change
   repository visibility → Private.** Only C.Lee does this. The lockdown
   commit does not change visibility.

Until step 3 lands, strangers can still read the live tool catalog and talk
to `/mcp/public`. Until step 5, the source stays world-readable.

## Preflight — before you ship

`scripts/railway_preflight.py` runs two checks and exits non-zero if either
fails, so it works as a gate in a shell or in CI:

- **Migration parity** (needs `DATABASE_URL`) — compares the Alembic head in
  this tree against the `alembic_version` row in the target database. A tree
  ahead of the deployed schema is the failure that produces a 500 on the first
  request touching a new table. It also detects a `create_all`-bootstrapped DB
  with no `alembic_version` row and tells you to `alembic stamp head` once
  before enabling `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START`.
- **Off-platform migration parity** (`--public-db`, needs
  `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`) — uses only the explicit public PostgreSQL URL. It
  never falls back to the private `DATABASE_URL`; missing, local, or
  private-looking values fail closed without printing the URL.
- **Live posture** (needs `PUBLIC_URL` or `--url`) — asserts the deployed
  service is healthy, reports `production_like=true`, has no unhealthy
  dependency, did **not** fall back to memory state, and has both
  `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=false` and
  `ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL=false`. Add `--expected-version` and
  `--expected-commit-sha` after deployment to require exact release identity
  from both `/health` and `/health/dependencies`; the SHA must be the full
  40-character value. Production health intentionally omits the dogfood flag,
  so load the existing operator credential into `BOOTSTRAP_KEY` from the
  approved secret store before this check. The preflight sends it only as the
  `X-API-Key` header to `/v1/discover`; there is no CLI secret argument and the
  value is never printed.
- **Customer deployment manifest** (`--manifest`) — validates the strict
  non-secret JSON record, requires its Alembic revision and commit SHA to equal
  this release checkout, and rejects tracked or ordinary untracked worktree
  changes that could make the `railway up` source differ from that SHA. It
  supplies its public URL and commit SHA to the live check and rejects a
  separately supplied URL or SHA that disagrees. The live gate also requires
  the configured signing key id: any id exposed by health must match, and
  `/.well-known/trust-keys.json` must always publish that id exactly once as an
  active Ed25519 key with valid 32-byte public material under the manifest
  URL's issuer. The SHA-256 fingerprint of that raw public key must equal the
  manifest's independently recorded fingerprint.

```bash
# Both checks for a deployment whose database is reachable from this machine:
railway run python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py

# Schema parity only:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://… python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py --db

# Legacy off-platform parity diagnostic. This requires a temporary public
# database proxy and is not acceptable evidence for customer-data qualification:
railway run --service Postgres --environment production -- \
  python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py --db --public-db --strict

# Pre-deploy posture only, against the currently running release:
python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py --live --url "$API_URL"

# Post-deploy posture plus exact release identity:
python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py --live --strict --url "$API_URL" \
  --expected-version "1.3.0" \
  --expected-commit-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"

# Managed single-tenant post-deploy gate; URL, commit, revision, and key id
# come from the non-secret manifest:
python3 scripts/railway_preflight.py --live --strict \
  --manifest /path/to/example-customer.production.json

# Managed single-tenant schema parity, run inside the deployed API container
# where private DATABASE_URL is reachable. This DB-only check intentionally
# omits --manifest because the image does not contain .git or the external
# customer operations record:
railway ssh --service api-service --environment production -- \
  python scripts/railway_preflight.py --db --strict
```

[`railway ssh`](https://docs.railway.com/cli/ssh) requires an operator SSH key
registered with Railway. Copy the exact SSH target command from the Railway
service dashboard if the local CLI is not already linked. Run the in-container
DB check and the local
manifest-bound live check as separate post-deploy gates; both must pass.

A check whose input is absent is **skipped**, not failed; pass `--strict` to
turn a skip into a failure (what CI and the deploy workflow use). Shorthands:
`make railway-preflight` and `make railway-preflight-live`.

### Private operator release (required for customer data)

Do not give GitHub Actions a Railway workspace SSH key. A project-scoped token
cannot manage Railway SSH keys, while a workspace key reaches every service in
the workspace. Keep the release operator-local and register one controlled key
only for the maintenance window.

Use Railway CLI 5.43 or newer. This version does not accept
`railway up --build-arg`; prepare the immutable release context instead. The
sentinel below is mandatory even on a newer CLI: an SSH command that returns
zero without actually running must not approve a release.

From a clean detached checkout of the exact commit:

The generic sequence below is deliberately blocked for the **first activation**
of migration 037. This repository does not yet name a proven Railway
ingress-block/private-verification mechanism. Before removing the stop, a
customer-specific runbook must identify the actual ingress block and controlled
bypass, prove every old request drained, apply 037 out of band, start the exact
SHA as the sole traffic-eligible release, run private schema and health checks
while public traffic remains blocked, and only then resume ingress.
`RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START` does not pause or drain the old release.

Afterward, inspect application and HTTP logs for tracebacks, dependency
degradation, or unexpected 5xx responses. A failed private sentinel, schema
check, exact-SHA check, health check, or critical user flow is a rollback
trigger. Roll back by deploying the previously green exact SHA through this
same sequence; never reverse database migrations. For migration 037, first
follow the [dispatch-claim rollback gate](#dispatch-claim-migration-and-rollback).
Migrations used for a rolling release must remain compatible with that rollback
release.

### Customer operations manifest

Copy [`railway-customer-manifest.example.json`](railway-customer-manifest.example.json)
to a controlled operations location **outside the release checkout** and
replace every example value. Keeping the live manifest outside the checkout
avoids a recursive commit-identity problem and lets the clean-source guard
prove what `railway up` will upload. The manifest contains only these
non-secret fields:

- schema version, customer slug, Railway project id, environment, and region
- canonical public HTTPS origin and Ed25519 signing key id (maximum 64
  lowercase safe characters)
- lowercase SHA-256 digest of the raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key
- exact deployed 40-character Git SHA and Alembic head revision

Compute and record `signing_public_key_sha256` from the intended key material
before deployment as `sha256(raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key)`. Use the public
key output from the controlled key-generation step; the seed must never be
printed or put in the manifest. Do not populate the expected fingerprint by
copying the deployed `/.well-known/trust-keys.json` value during qualification:
that would make the verification tautological and allow the wrong deployed key
to approve itself.

Do not add database/Redis URLs, API keys, signing seeds, Sentinel keys, MCP
tokens, administrator credentials, customer data, or other secrets. Unknown
fields are rejected so the manifest cannot silently become a credential store.
The committed example's all-zero commit is a format placeholder and must never
be used for a deployment. Its public-key fingerprint is also synthetic example
data and must be replaced from the intended customer's key-generation record.

The preflight first binds the manifest's commit and revision to the local
release checkout and refuses a dirty worktree, then can remotely attest the
public URL, application commit, schema revision (when `--db` runs), and
active signing-key publication and fingerprint. It records the Railway
project id, environment, and region but cannot remotely attest those three
values without Railway control-plane API access. The private operator release
checklist therefore derives the project and environment selectors from this
manifest and validates them through Railway before deployment. A `railway up`
source build does not currently expose a stable runtime image
digest to this application, so the baked `.build_commit_sha` from the immutable
release context is the attested release identity and image digest is explicitly
**not verified** for this pilot. Do not invent or record a guessed digest.

Store a copy of the completed manifest with the deployment record and update
the expected commit and revision before every release. The preflight fails
closed if the recorded revision is stale, the live URL or commit differs, or
the active customer signing key cannot be verified.

### Rolling retirement of legacy owner keys

Migration `025_remove_plaintext_owner_keys` scrubs `wallets.owner_key` and
`service_registry.owner_key`, but deliberately retains both empty columns and
their indexes for this release. The previously deployed worker still selects
and writes those columns, so dropping them during an overlapping Railway
deployment would break requests before that worker drains.

An old worker can write a plaintext owner credential after migration 025
performs its first scrub, or an unbound refresh token after migration 028 runs.
Therefore a deploy is incomplete until Railway reports that the new deployment
is the only active worker set and the idempotent post-deploy retirement passes:

```bash
# Run only after the old deployment has fully drained. Pin the command to the
# new API instance, whose DATABASE_URL reaches Postgres privately.
railway ssh --project "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --service api-service --environment production \
  --deployment-instance "$INSTANCE_ID" -- \
  python scripts/retire_owner_keys.py --private-db
```

The command locks all three affected tables for its transaction, replaces any
late non-empty owner-key value with the empty compatibility marker, revokes any
NULL-bound refresh token, and verifies both invariants. It fails if
the selected private `DATABASE_URL` is absent or not a Railway-private
PostgreSQL URL, or if any required retirement column is missing. It never falls
back to `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`. A later contract migration may drop the
owner-key columns only after this release can no longer be running.

## Validating a release in CI

`.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` is a manual, **validation-only**
`workflow_dispatch`. It checks out the selected ref, requires successful CI for
that exact commit, verifies the current production posture, and records the
candidate SHA and version. It never holds a Railway token or SSH key, changes a
variable, runs `railway up`, or connects through `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`.

The workflow requires:

| Setting | Kind | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| `PUBLIC_URL` | repo **variable** | Public API origin, used by the pre-deploy posture check |

The workflow's green result means “candidate prepared,” not “deployed.” The
operator must then use the private release checklist above. This separation
keeps workspace-wide SSH authority out of GitHub while preserving exact-SHA,
post-drain credential retirement, private schema parity, and live posture
gates.

## After deploy — verify

```bash
export API_URL="${PUBLIC_URL:-https://api.thisisatest.tech}"

curl -sS "$API_URL/health"
curl -sS "$API_URL/health/dependencies"   # fell_back_to_memory=false; postgres up
curl -sS "$API_URL/.well-known/agent.json"  # proof_surfaces_enabled=false
curl -sS "$API_URL/mcp/tools.json"        # no awi_* / marketplace stubs when proof off
curl -sS "$API_URL/llms.txt"              # Base URL = PUBLIC_URL
```

Expect:

- No `trust_mode_permissive` warning in Railway logs for production.
- `/health/dependencies` → `runtime_degradation.durable_state.fell_back_to_memory=false`.
- `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=false` reflected in health / agent.json.
- `/health` and `/health/dependencies` report the expected application version
  and exact 40-character deployed `commit_sha`, with
  `build_provenance: "stamped"` on both. Then follow the
  [deployment verification checklist](deployment-verification-checklist.md)
  before describing any commit as live.
- `ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL=false`; `/mcp/tools.json` contains no simulated dogfood
  tool ids.

## Pilot qualification and rollout

Qualify every customer stack with synthetic or redacted data before onboarding:

1. Confirm the manifest against the linked Railway project, environment,
   region, unique domain, and configured signing key id; run strict schema and
   live preflight checks.
2. Confirm the API is the only public service, PostgreSQL and Redis have no
   public domain/TCP proxy, and the customer has unique database, Redis,
   administrator, signing, and upstream credentials. If Sentinel-backed human
   approval is enabled, also confirm a unique Sentinel tenant and credentials.
3. Exercise the complete trust loop: provision → authenticate → permit → quote
   → invoke → meter → receipt → audit → offline verification → replay. If
   Sentinel-backed human approval is enabled, additionally exercise approve
   and deny with synthetic or redacted arguments. Verify governed denials do
   not charge and portable evidence verifies with the published customer key.
4. Test cross-customer isolation from both directions: a customer-A key must be
   rejected by customer B, a customer-B key must be rejected by customer A,
   each trust-key document must omit the other customer's key id, and the
   database/signing-key identifiers must differ. Never print or copy the key
   values into the qualification record.
5. Complete and record the provider-backup restore drill. Prefer a PITR-created
   sibling and re-run the trust loop there before removing it through the
   [restore drill teardown](#restore-drill-teardown) below. Do not treat an
   ordinary volume-backup restore as disposable: it replaces the source
   service's mounted volume and removes backups newer than the selected point.

Roll out first to an internal dedicated stack, then to one low-sensitivity
design partner. Stop promotion if deployment provenance, schema parity,
private data-service exposure, restore verification, denial portability,
metering integrity, signing-key publication, or cross-customer rejection fails.

Do not accept regulated production data or offer customer-VPC/BYOC until the
product has KMS/HSM signing through workload identity, enterprise SSO/RBAC,
private customer-tool connectivity, retention/deletion/legal-hold controls,
SIEM export, tested backup and disaster-recovery targets, append-only or
externally anchored audit evidence, and approved subprocessor/data-flow review.
Do not introduce shared SaaS until organization tenancy, PostgreSQL RLS,
tenant-scoped administration, per-tenant keys/upstreams, and adversarial
isolation tests exist.

### Restore drill teardown

A PITR drill leaves a sibling PostgreSQL service running in the customer's
production project. The drill is not complete until that sibling is gone. An
abandoned sibling keeps a second copy of the customer's database credentials
and a live `WAL_RECOVER_FROM_*` recovery credential set inside the production
project, and Railway will redeploy it on its own long after the drill ended.
Tear it down in the same operator session that ran the drill.

1. Verify the drill result before removing anything. The sibling must have
   reached the intended recovery target and served the trust loop re-run from
   qualification step 3. A sibling that never started — for example one whose
   volume was never mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data` — is a failed drill,
   not a passed one. Record the failure, delete it the same way, and re-run.
2. Record the drill in the controlled operations record next to the customer
   manifest, never in this checkout and never in the manifest itself: date,
   source backup or recovery target, restore mode (PITR sibling or
   volume-backup swap), verification result, and operator. Do not record
   database URLs, passwords, recovery bucket credentials, connection strings,
   or any row from the restored database.
3. Confirm no customer data leaves with the operator. Close every session
   against the sibling, and do not copy, dump, or export restored rows for
   inspection outside it. Evidence that the drill passed is the trust-loop
   result, not exported data.
4. Confirm nothing depends on the sibling, then delete the service **and** its
   volume in Railway. Check that no other service holds a reference variable
   pointing at the sibling's private endpoint, then delete the service and
   delete its volume explicitly. Railway does not remove a service's volume for
   you, and a retained drill volume is an unmanaged copy of customer data.
   Deleting the sibling does not remove backups: it holds only recovery-side
   `WAL_RECOVER_FROM_*` settings, while the source keeps its own
   `WAL_ARCHIVE_*` configuration and the backup repository is unchanged.
5. Confirm the source PostgreSQL service is still online and archiving after
   the teardown. Its own volume must still be mounted at
   `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, its latest deployment must be healthy, and its
   logs must show archive pushes completing with no failed or queued WAL. Treat
   a stalled archive as a release-blocking failure, not drill cleanup noise.

Never delete, rename, or reconfigure the source service as part of teardown.
If the drill used the volume-backup mode instead, the source service is itself
the restored service: there is no sibling to remove, and the teardown step is
replaced by confirming the source's identity, schema revision, and archiving
before the maintenance window closes.

### Dogfood is local-only

Do not enable `ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL` in production to improve health-page optics
or simulate an upstream partner. The checked-in dogfood loop remains available
as local test evidence:

```bash
make dogfood-trust-plane
```

Operator checklist script (unauthenticated discovery only):

```bash
API_URL="$API_URL" bash scripts/human_preflight.sh
```

## OpenAPI servers note

FastAPI OpenAPI lists `PUBLIC_URL` as the public API server. A
`http://localhost:8000` entry is included only when
`is_production_like_environment(ENVIRONMENT)` is false (local/dev/test/ci).
That is local-dev documentation — not a second deploy target. Production
agents should use `PUBLIC_URL`.
