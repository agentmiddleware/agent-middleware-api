# Schema 041: content owner-key scrub and rollback boundary

Migration `041_scrub_content_owner_keys` revises `040_permit_repeat_window`.
It is data-only. It blanks `owner_key` in `content_pipelines` and
`content_campaigns` wherever the value is not a known wallet id; those values
were raw API keys stored by the content factory before it recorded wallet ids.
No column changes shape. The downgrade is a no-op: the scrubbed values were
credentials and are not restored.

## Buyer impact

Owners of pre-wallet pipelines and campaigns lose API read access when 041
runs: their rows become ownerless, which only bootstrap admins can read.
This matches the access those rows already had in practice (no wallet id
could ever equal a raw key), but it is still a visible change for any
integration listing old content. Tell buyers before a paid pilot: legacy
content rows need operator-assisted recovery, and downgrading to 040
restores no access.

## Release

No compatibility release is needed, because no schema shape changes. Workers
already running a 040 image keep serving while 041 is applied; the schema
check runs only at startup.

1. Confirm the production database is at `040_permit_repeat_window`. An earlier
   revision needs its own migration review first.
2. Deploy the reviewed main SHA through the canonical exact-SHA path in
   [deploy-railway.md](deploy-railway.md), with `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START=true`
   so the entrypoint applies 041 before uvicorn starts.
3. Record the deployed SHA, deployment id, and the result of the private schema
   parity check. That SHA is now the earliest valid recovery image.

## Rollback after activation

Once the database is at 041, an image whose packaged Alembic head is 040 cannot
start again. Two independent checks stop it:

- The entrypoint's `alembic upgrade head` fails with
  `Can't locate revision identified by '041_scrub_content_owner_keys'` and
  exits non-zero, so uvicorn never starts.
- Without migration-on-start, the boot schema check refuses the database. Its
  message reads `Database Alembic revision is behind packaged head:
  current=['041_scrub_content_owner_keys'] heads=['040_permit_repeat_window']`,
  although the database is ahead of the image, not behind it.

Both were reproduced against a database migrated to 041, using the images at
`34fbdb9` (merged main serving first-party production when 041 merged) and
`e18b0df` (the schema-040 compatibility release recorded in
[schema-040-rollout.md](schema-040-rollout.md)). Neither, nor `8c95229`, is a
valid recovery image after 041 is applied.

Roll back only to an image whose packaged head is 041 or later. Do not run
`alembic downgrade` to 040 as a rollback. It restores no data and only moves
the stamp, which would let a 040 image start and resume writing raw API keys
into `owner_key` on any deployment that mounts the content factory.
