# Key Management

How the trust-plane signing key is loaded today, how it is intended to be
managed in production, and what specifically changes when moving from the
env-var-based loader to an external KMS.

This document is normative for the Ed25519 key that signs permits, receipts,
and audit-chain entries. It is not the only secret in the system, but it is
the secret that the trust-plane guarantees depend on. If this key is
compromised, every receipt and permit becomes forgeable from the moment of
compromise forward.

## Current Posture

The active key is loaded by `SigningKeyService._load_private_key` in
`app/services/signing_keys.py`. The loader has two modes:

1. **Configured key** — `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` (set in
   `app/core/config.py`) must be strict standard base64 that decodes to exactly
   the 32 raw bytes accepted by `Ed25519PrivateKey.from_private_bytes`. PEM,
   hex, 64-byte seed-plus-public-key concatenations, and double-encoded base64
   are rejected. The decoded private bytes never leave the process.
2. **Ephemeral fallback** — if the env var is empty and `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED`
   is false, the loader generates a process-local `Ed25519PrivateKey` that
   exists only in memory and dies with the process. This path exists so local
   tests can exercise sign/verify without persisting key material to disk.

If `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED` is true and the env var is empty, the loader raises
`SigningKeyError("trust_signing_private_key_required")`. There is no silent
fallback in trust mode.

Public-key metadata (key ID, base64 public key, status, activation time) is
persisted in the `SigningKeyModel` table and is the basis for offline receipt
verification. The private key is never persisted.

### Why the current posture is acceptable for MVP

- The private key lives only in the process memory of API workers
- Hosting platforms (Railway, Fly, AWS) inject the env var from their own
  secret stores at deploy time
- Public-key metadata is auditable (`GET /v1/signing-keys/active`,
  `GET /v1/signing-keys/{key_id}`, `GET /v1/signing-keys/`); rotation and
  retirement run through operator routes (`POST /v1/signing-keys/rotate`,
  `POST /v1/signing-keys/retire`, bootstrap admin only, see
  [Status](#status))
- The trust boundary documented in `SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md` is consistent
  with this loader

### Why it is not production-grade

- The private key is recoverable by anyone with access to the process env
  (sidecar, debugger, `/proc`, crash dump, container introspection)
- There is no hardware-rooted custody
- There is no separation between signing authority and the workload that
  invokes signing
- Rotation requires re-deploying with a new env var, which couples key
  rotation to release cadence

## Production Target: External KMS

In production, signing must happen inside an external KMS, and the API worker
must never hold raw private bytes. Three providers are supported as targets;
the choice is per-deployment.

### Provider Targets

| Provider | Key type | Sign API | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS KMS | `ECC_NIST_P256` (until KMS adds Ed25519) or external-key import | `Sign` with `SigningAlgorithm=ECDSA_SHA_256` or imported-key Ed25519 | CloudTrail logs every `Sign` call |
| GCP KMS | `ASYMMETRIC_SIGN` Ed25519 | `AsymmetricSign` | Cloud Audit Logs every `AsymmetricSign` call |
| HashiCorp Vault Transit | `ed25519` | `transit/sign/:name` | Vault audit device |

The receipt format does not change. `alg` stays `Ed25519` for Vault and GCP
KMS. For AWS KMS until Ed25519 is native, the `alg` field becomes
`ECDSA-P256-SHA256` and verification code must accept both algorithms keyed
by the receipt's `alg` field.

### Concrete code changes

The integration points are narrow because the loader was designed for this:

1. **`app/services/signing_keys.py`** — replace `_load_private_key` with a
   provider strategy. The strategy returns an opaque key handle, not raw
   bytes. `sign_payload_with_key_id` calls `strategy.sign(message)` instead
   of `self._private_key.sign(message)`.

2. **`app/core/config.py`** — add:
   - `TRUST_KMS_PROVIDER` (`env` | `aws_kms` | `gcp_kms` | `vault_transit`)
   - `TRUST_KMS_KEY_REF` (ARN, resource name, or Vault key name)
   - `TRUST_KMS_REGION` (where relevant)
   - `TRUST_KMS_ROLE_ARN` / equivalent workload-identity binding

3. **`SigningKeyService.ensure_active_key`** — the public-key metadata path
   stays the same, but the public key is fetched from the KMS once at
   startup and cached, rather than derived from the local private key.

4. **`SigningKeyService.rotate_active_key_metadata`** — gains a real
   counterpart: a rotation flow that creates a new KMS key version, marks the
   old metadata row `retired`, inserts the new metadata row, and begins
   signing under the new `kid` without breaking historical verification.

5. **Health checks** — add a `/healthz/kms` endpoint that performs a no-op
   signing round-trip and reports KMS latency. This is the early-warning
   signal for KMS misconfiguration.

The signing call path stays a single function call; only the implementation
changes.

### Workload identity, not static credentials

The API worker must authenticate to the KMS using workload identity, not a
static credential:

- **AWS** — IAM role attached to the task/pod, scoped to `kms:Sign` on
  exactly the trust-plane key ARN. No `kms:GetPublicKey` is required after
  startup if the public key is cached.
- **GCP** — Workload Identity binding, scoped to `roles/cloudkms.signer` on
  exactly the trust-plane key resource.
- **Vault** — Kubernetes auth or AppRole with a policy that allows
  `update` on `transit/sign/<key>` and nothing else.

The KMS audit log becomes the canonical record of "who signed what when."
This is the property that closes the gap in `SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md` between
"receipts are verifiable" and "receipts are non-repudiable."

## Rotation Flow Under KMS

> **Target state, not implemented.** This flow is the design for after the
> KMS integration ships. The operator rotate and retire routes exist today
> (`POST /v1/signing-keys/rotate`, `POST /v1/signing-keys/retire`), but they
> rotate key ids against the gateway's current signing material; the KMS
> counterpart (new key version without redeploy) is still future work. For
> what rotation means now, see [Status](#status).

Rotation under KMS is metadata + key-version change, not a redeploy:

1. Operator creates a new key version in the KMS (`aws kms
   create-key` for a new key, or version rotation on an existing key).
2. Operator calls a new admin route (proposed:
   `POST /v1/admin/signing-keys/rotate`) with the new key reference and a new
   `kid`.
3. `rotate_active_key_metadata` marks the prior metadata row `retired`
   (retains it for verification of pre-rotation receipts), inserts the new
   metadata row, and flips the active `kid`.
4. Subsequent `sign_payload` calls produce receipts under the new `kid`.
5. Verification continues to work for receipts under the old `kid` because
   the retired metadata row is still queryable.
6. No worker restart is required.

The same rotation flow runs unattended on a schedule (e.g., quarterly) via a
cron job that calls the admin endpoint with a service identity.

## Compromise Response

If a signing key is suspected of compromise:

1. **Disable**, not retire, the affected `kid` — set `status="disabled"` so
   `verify_payload` rejects signatures bound to it.
2. Rotate to a new KMS key version immediately.
3. Re-issue any unconsumed permits under the new `kid`. Receipts already
   produced under the disabled key are no longer accepted by verification;
   downstream consumers must re-acquire authorization.
4. Publish the compromised `kid` to any external transparency log used by
   consumers.

The audit chain itself is signed and hash-linked. If the signing key is
rotated, the chain continues — each entry references its signing `kid`, so a
verifier can walk a chain that spans key rotations.

## What This Does Not Solve

This document covers the trust-plane signing key. It does not cover:

- API-key custody (`VALID_API_KEYS`, DB-backed API keys) — rotation for
  these is covered in `docs/api-key-rotation.md`
- Stripe webhook secrets
- Database credentials
- TLS material

Those secrets follow the standard host secret-manager pattern and are out of
scope for the trust-plane key-management story.

## Status

Until the KMS integration ships, the production posture is:

- `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED=true` and `ALLOW_LEGACY_UNPERMITTED_MCP=false` are the
  shipped defaults; nothing extra to configure
- `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` injected at deploy time from the hosting
  platform secret manager
- Operator key rotation is served by the gateway (`app/routers/keys.py`,
  bootstrap admin only):
  - `GET /v1/signing-keys/` lists every published key with its status, so a
    rollover window with more than one `active` key is visible
  - `POST /v1/signing-keys/rotate` moves signing to a new `kid` and retires
    the previous one in one call
  - `POST /v1/signing-keys/retire` retires a superseded key; retired keys
    stay published so old receipts keep verifying. The key that is still
    signing cannot be retired (rotate first)
- Two rotation paths, depending on whether the private material changes:
  - **New key material**: redeploy with a new `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`
    paired with a new `TRUST_SIGNING_KEY_ID`. The redeploy activates the new
    `kid` but does not retire the old one
    (`SigningKeyService.ensure_active_key`), so both stay `active` until an
    operator retires the old one with `POST /v1/signing-keys/retire`. The
    post-rotation steps are in [`deploy-railway.md`](deploy-railway.md).
  - **Same material, new `kid`** (for example a scheduled id rollover):
    `POST /v1/signing-keys/rotate` alone is enough.
- After either path, restart or redeploy every gateway replica with the new
  `TRUST_SIGNING_KEY_ID` so all signers converge. Until then a replica still
  on the old id keeps signing artifacts that verify under its `kid`, which is
  valid history, not forgery.
- The auditor handoff for verifying receipts against these keys is
  [`auditor-guide.md`](auditor-guide.md).

This is documented as a known limitation in `SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md` and
should be the default answer to "where do the private keys live?" until the
KMS work lands.
