# Related Work And Claim Evidence

This document maps external literature to the repo's narrow product wedge:

```text
discover -> authenticate -> authorize -> invoke -> meter -> receipt -> audit -> govern
```

The sources below are context for design and positioning. They do not by
themselves prove production readiness, compliance, settlement safety, or
enterprise suitability. Repo claims still need code, tests, docs, or executable
demo evidence.

For the inward-facing counterpart — repo mechanisms verified against their own
source, with evidence-confidence markers — see
[`docs/invention-inventory.md`](invention-inventory.md).

## Product Boundary

Verified from repo:

- The current wedge is a governed trust plane for scoped, metered MCP tool calls
  in `WEDGE.md`.
- The current proof path is signed permit, governed MCP invoke, wallet charge,
  signed receipt, ledger entry, audit chain verification, replay safety, and
  out-of-scope denial in `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`.
- AWI, browser automation, content generation, oracle crawls, media utilities,
  IoT bridges, red-team services, RTaaS, telemetry auto-PR, and sandbox demos
  are proof surfaces, not the initial product boundary, in `WEDGE.md`.

## Claim Evidence Matrix

| Public claim | Repo evidence | Reality level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The product wedge is an MCP trust plane, not a broad agent platform. | `WEDGE.md` defines the wedge and lists non-core proof surfaces. | Verified. |
| Agents can discover machine-readable interfaces. | `README.md` points agents to `/.well-known/agent.json`, `/llm.txt`, `/mcp/tools.json`, and `/openapi.json`; discovery drift tests exist in `tests/test_discovery_drift.py`. | Verified. |
| Signed permits bind wallet, key, tool, scope, budget, expiry, and nonce. | `app/services/permits.py` creates signed permits and validates wallet, key, tool, scope, budget, expiry, and signature; `tests/test_permits.py` covers valid and invalid cases. | Verified. |
| Governed MCP requires permits and idempotency in strict trust mode. | `app/routers/mcp.py` enforces permit and idempotency checks for governed calls; `tests/test_mcp_trust_mode.py` covers missing permit, missing idempotency, wrong key, wrong wallet, and wrong tool. | Verified. |
| Successful governed invokes charge the wallet and emit signed receipts. | `app/routers/mcp.py` charges through `AgentMoney`, records audit, and creates receipts; `tests/test_demo_trust_plane.py` and `tests/test_agent_ops_war_room_demo.py` assert success receipts and replay behavior. | Verified. |
| Denied governed attempts are auditable and can produce denial receipts when a permit record exists. | `app/routers/mcp.py` creates denial receipts for invalid scoped attempts with an existing permit; strict-mode tests assert denial audit events. | Verified. |
| Receipts are signature-verifiable. | `app/services/receipts.py` signs and verifies receipt payloads; `tests/test_receipts.py` detects receipt tampering. | Verified. |
| Wallet audit events are signed and hash-linked. | `app/services/audit_chain.py` signs audit events and verifies payload hash, previous hash, signature, and chain hash; `tests/test_audit_chain.py` detects tampering. | Verified. |
| Wallet keys can inspect only their own trust ledger records. | `app/routers/me.py`, `app/routers/receipts.py`, and `app/routers/audit.py` enforce wallet-scoped access; `tests/test_me_trust_ledger.py` covers cross-wallet exclusion. | Verified. |
| Payment settlement is production-ready. | `WEDGE.md` explicitly says not to claim production-ready payments or settlement. | Contradicted if claimed. |
| Ledger storage is compliance-grade. | `WEDGE.md` explicitly says not to claim compliance-grade ledger storage. | Contradicted if claimed. |
| Universal policy enforcement across every agent framework exists. | `WEDGE.md` explicitly says not to claim universal policy enforcement across every agent framework. | Contradicted if claimed. |

## How To Use These Sources

- Use AWI sources to explain proof surfaces, not the core wedge.
- Use MCP sources to justify why this repo sits at the tool boundary.
- Use wallet/payment sources to explain bounded authority and spend controls,
  while avoiding production settlement claims.
- Use Macaroons and token literature to explain the authorization lineage of
  scoped permits without claiming compatibility.
- Use audit/evidence sources to justify signed receipts and hash-linked audit
  chains, while keeping regulated-compliance claims out of product copy.
- Treat in-toto, Sigstore, SCITT, and Rekor as a later wrap-and-anchor
  composition for independently timestamped publication of receipt
  hashes, not as the product wedge, not as independent key distribution
  unless a trust root other than this origin is named, and not as a
  claim of non-equivocation. See [`WEDGE.md`](../WEDGE.md) § What To Freeze.
- Treat a new portable permit envelope and a portable audit-chain export
  the same way: frozen until a named partner cannot use the shipped
  `GET /v1/permits/{id}` + `LocalPermitValidator` path, or cannot trust
  first-party audit verification. Existing receipt portable export stays.
- Use threat-model sources to keep prompt injection, protocol exploit, replay,
  confused deputy, unsafe tool execution, and cross-tenant leakage in scope.
- Use NIST as governance vocabulary, not as proof of certification or
  compliance.

## Current Evidence Slice

`GET /v1/receipts/{receipt_id}/evidence` answers one operator question:

> Given a receipt ID, can I verify the receipt signature, permit signature,
> audit-chain linkage, ledger linkage, and wallet-scoped access in one call?

This strengthens the signed receipt ledger wedge without expanding the product
surface.
