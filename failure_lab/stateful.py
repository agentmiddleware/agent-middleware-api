"""Property-based, stateful exploration of the governed-call lifecycle.

The fourteen scenarios in :mod:`failure_lab.scenarios` each ask one question
the authors already knew to ask. This module asks the questions nobody wrote
down: it generates command sequences from a seeded random source, drives them
against a real gateway, and checks a fixed set of invariants against what was
observed. Its value is entirely in finding interleavings a human would not
have enumerated -- a revoke between the debit and the claim, a reconcile
between two retries that present different keys for the same refund.

Three commitments make the output usable as evidence rather than anecdote:

**Seeded, therefore reproducible.** Every sequence comes from
``random.Random(seed)``. The master seed and each sequence's derived seed are
recorded in the result, so ``--seed 7`` run tomorrow generates the same work.
Identifiers are derived from the seed too, not minted per process.

**Invariants are stated over observations, never over the implementation.**
Each invariant is phrased as a relation between numbers taken from the
independent effect ledger, the fault layer outside the gateway, and the
client's own view of its attempts. None of them says "the code does X". Where
a check can only be made against a gateway-reported number -- the wallet's
own debit and receipt rows -- the finding carries ``source:
"gateway-reported"`` and is never presented as an independent observation.

**A violation is reduced before it is reported.** A forty-command sequence
that trips an invariant is not a bug report; it is a haystack. The shrinker
repeatedly drops commands and re-runs, keeping any shorter sequence that
still trips the *same* invariant, and records how much of its budget it
spent. A sequence that will not reproduce is reported unminimized and
labelled as such, because a flaky violation is a real thing to know about.

What this module does **not** establish: the absence of violations is not a
proof of correctness. It is the statement that this seed, at this length,
found none -- which is what the result document says, in those words.
