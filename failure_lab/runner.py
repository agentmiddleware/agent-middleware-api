"""One command that turns a scenario suite into an evidence bundle.

Everything here exists because the individual pieces are each only half of an
argument. A ``ScenarioResult`` is a measurement nobody can re-check; a
``Comparison`` is a reading of that measurement; a claims manifest is a list of
sentences someone is allowed to say; a bundle is the bytes a stranger needs to
disagree. :func:`run_lab` is the thing that produces all four from the same
run, so they cannot drift apart between a marketing page and the code.

Four decisions in here are load-bearing, and all four are about not lying:

**The sandbox is pinned before the application is imported.**
:func:`failure_lab.gateway.boot_standalone_environment` writes the sandbox
posture into ``os.environ`` and refuses to run once ``app.main`` is in
``sys.modules``, because the application caches its settings at import. Every
``app`` import in this module is therefore inside :func:`_execute`, after the
boot call. A module-level ``import app`` would silently produce a run against
whatever posture the ambient environment happened to have -- which is the one
failure this harness could never detect from its own output.

**A scenario that raises does not take the run with it.** It is recorded as an
``ERROR`` verdict and the suite continues. The synthetic result marks the
configurations the scenario would have exercised ``NOT_RUN`` and puts the
traceback on a separate ``harness`` row, rather than stamping ``ERROR`` on the
configuration columns:
:func:`failure_lab.report.build_comparison` treats an ``ERROR`` column as a
column that *ran*, and a crashed T03 whose naive baseline shows zero duplicate
effects would be reported as "your existing integration handled this test
correctly". An error must read as an error, never as a pass.

**An undocumented improvement fails the release too.** ``exit_status`` is
non-zero when any observed verdict differs from the documented expectation in
either direction. A P0 invariant regressing and a scenario quietly starting to
pass mean the same thing -- the documentation and the tests disagree -- and
only one of them is tempting to ignore.

**The run directory is removed when the run made it.** Cleanup runs in a
``finally``, so a failure does not leave a sandbox database behind. It removes
only a directory this function created; a caller-supplied ``run_dir`` is the
caller's, and ``rmtree`` on a path someone else named is not recoverable. That
is also why ``--output`` exists: it is how the evidence bundle outlives the
run.

The bundle lands in ``<run_dir>/evidence`` rather than in ``run_dir`` itself,
because :func:`failure_lab.evidence.verify_bundle_integrity` reports any file
in the bundle tree that the manifest does not list -- correctly, an index that
ignores extra files is not an index. The telemetry log, the claims manifest and
``run.json`` are therefore siblings of the bundle, not contents of it, and the
sandbox's own state (the gateway database and the effect ledgers) goes in
``<run_dir>/sandbox``, which is emptied at the start of every run. See
:func:`_prepare_sandbox` for why sharing it between runs breaks every
signature.
