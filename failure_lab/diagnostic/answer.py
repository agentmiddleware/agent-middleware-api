"""Turn a lab run into the one answer a visitor came for.

Everything here is derived from :class:`~failure_lab.report.ConclusionKind`
values that were themselves computed from instrument counts. Nothing in this
module decides what a run *means* -- it decides how to say what the run already
concluded, in a fixed vocabulary, in a fixed order of precedence.

Three rules shape the whole module and each of them is a rule against the
obvious temptation:

1. **A failure of the product outranks anything good the product did.** If any
   scenario reached ``gateway_did_not_hold`` or ``gateway_added_duplicates``,
   that is the headline, above every duplicate the gateway prevented in the
   same run. A page that leads with the win and footnotes the failure is an
   advertisement.

2. **"You may not need us" is a real answer with its own headline.** It is not
   a softened version of a recommendation and it is not followed by a reason to
   buy anyway. The PRD calls this result a feature; a feature has to be
   reachable, so :func:`headline_for` has a branch that reaches it and a test
   that drives it.

3. **A test with no baseline says nothing about whether you need us.** Nine of
   the fourteen P0 scenarios exercise a component only the gateway has, so no
   baseline column runs. Those scenarios can establish that the gateway held
   its own guarantee and they can establish nothing at all about the visitor's
   own integration. That distinction survives into the headline rather than
   being flattened into either direction.

There is no score. Not a risk score, not a readiness score, not a percentage,
not a grade. The PRD forbids manufacturing one, and a number between 0 and 100
is exactly the kind of thing a reader trusts more than the measurements under
it. :func:`as_dict` emits counts of scenarios, which are facts, and no derived
index over them.
