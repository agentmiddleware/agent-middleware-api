"""Turning the harness's own event log into the line a visitor reads.

The PRD gives six lines for the lost-response experiment -- "Sending business
operation...", "Downstream executed operation.", "Response intentionally
removed.", "Client observed timeout.", "Retrying...", "Measuring downstream
effects..." -- and the obvious way to produce them is to print them on a timer
while a run happens somewhere else. That would be a screensaver. Every line
this module emits is derived from one
:class:`~failure_lab.scenarios.base.EventLog` entry that the scenario actually
wrote, and carries the instrument reading that entry recorded.

Three consequences of that choice, all of them constraints rather than
features:

**A line only appears when its evidence does.** "Downstream executed
operation." is emitted when the event carries a non-zero execution count read
from the effect ledger -- the file the gateway cannot reach. If the count is
absent the line is not printed, because the alternative is narrating an
execution nobody counted.

**"Response intentionally removed." needs the fault to have fired, not to have
been armed.** Arming is a separate line. The removal is claimed only when the
fault layer recorded a request crossing into the tool, the ledger recorded the
effect, and the caller still came away without a confirmed outcome. Those three
facts together are what "executed, then the answer vanished" means.

**An unrecognised step is printed, not dropped.** The scenario modules belong
to other people and their step vocabulary will change. A step this module does
not know renders the event's own message, so a new step degrades to a plain
line instead of a silent gap in the middle of somebody's experiment.
