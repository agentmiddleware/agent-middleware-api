"""Executing one diagnostic run, and destroying everything it touched.

This is deliberately *not* a call to :func:`failure_lab.runner.run_lab`, and
the reason is the whole design of this module.

**The boot happens once per process.**
:func:`~failure_lab.gateway.boot_standalone_environment` refuses to run once
``app.main`` is in ``sys.modules``, because the application caches its settings
at import time. ``run_lab`` boots on every call, which is correct for a CLI
that exits afterwards and fatal for a server that answers a second request. So
the sandbox is booted once, here, behind :func:`sandbox`, and every run after
the first reuses it.

**The step stream has to be live.** ``run_lab`` returns after everything has
finished; a page that wants to show an experiment happening needs the events
while they are being written. :class:`_StreamingLog` is an
:class:`~failure_lab.scenarios.base.EventLog` that calls back on every
``emit``, so the same entries that end up in the evidence bundle are what the
browser reads, in the order the scenario wrote them. Nothing is scripted and
nothing is paced.

**Each run gets its own ledger directory.** The effect ledgers are named after
the configuration and the test id and live in ``LabEnvironment.run_dir``. Two
runs sharing that directory would share ledger files, and the second run would
count the first run's executions as its own -- a silent, plausible,
catastrophic measurement error. A fresh directory per run is what makes the
numbers mean anything.

**The run directory is removed on every path.** It holds a sandbox database, an
effect ledger, and an evidence bundle whose manifest names secret-shaped
environment values it scanned for. The bundle is archived and read into memory
*before* the directory is deleted in a ``finally``, so what the visitor
downloads outlives the run and nothing else does.

**A leak is fatal, not a caveat.**
:func:`~failure_lab.evidence.build_evidence_bundle` raises
:class:`~failure_lab.evidence.SecretLeakError` if a known secret survived
redaction into the written bytes. That exception is not caught here. The run is
reported as failed and no report is served, because the alternative is serving
a report with a credential in it.
