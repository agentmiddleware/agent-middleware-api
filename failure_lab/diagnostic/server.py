"""The HTTP surface: one page, one run at a time, on the loopback only.

Every refusal below is structural. A warning in the copy is a warning somebody
reads after the thing has already happened.

**Loopback only, and production refuses to boot at all.** :func:`serve` will
not bind anything but a loopback address, and :func:`create_app` calls
:func:`~failure_lab.diagnostic.runs.assert_not_production_like` against the
``ENVIRONMENT`` this process started with -- captured before
:func:`~failure_lab.gateway.boot_standalone_environment` can overwrite it with
``local``. A diagnostic that mints its own admin key, enables ``create_all``
and signs with an ephemeral seed has no business in a production process, and
the check that says so runs at construction, not at first request.

**The external-target code path is absent, not hidden.** With
``allow_external_targets`` false -- the default -- no handler object for it is
constructed and no route for it is registered, so the endpoint 404s because
there is nothing there. Turning the flag on does not enable an adapter either:
none is shipped, and the route that appears says so and sends nothing. The
choice to point failure traffic at somebody's system should cost more than a
boolean.

**One run at a time, and the second caller is told so.** The guard is a
synchronous check-and-set before the first ``await``, and a second run gets 429
rather than a queue slot. A diagnostic that queues is a diagnostic that can be
made to queue.

**No credential is accepted anywhere.** There is no field for one. A submission
whose bytes look like a credential is refused before it reaches ``json.loads``,
because a secret that reaches the parser has already been in memory, in a
buffer, and possibly in an error message.

**Nothing leaves without the redaction pass, and then a second look.** Every
run-derived body goes through :func:`failure_lab.evidence.redact` -- including
the SSE terminal event, which carries the one text on this surface nobody
composed, an exception message and a traceback -- and then
:meth:`DiagnosticService.guard` scans the finished bytes for every secret
value this process holds, the sandbox's own and each run's minted downstream
tokens, and refuses to serve the response if one survived. The bundle is
scanned a third time, by the evidence module, before it is written. A stream
substitutes rather than raises, because an exception out of a
``StreamingResponse`` truncates a body whose headers are already sent.
