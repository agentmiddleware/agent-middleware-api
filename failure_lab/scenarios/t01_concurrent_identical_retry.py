    WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
    -----------------
    1. Build one refund (``self.refund("pay_t01")``) and one identity
       (``OperationIdentity.first_attempt(operation_id)``).
    2. Fire ``self.options.get("concurrency", 100)`` submissions of that
       *identical* identity concurrently via ``asyncio.gather`` on
       ``target.agent.submit(identity.retry(), refund, timeout_seconds=...)``.
       ``identity.retry()`` keeps the idempotency key and the business
       operation id and varies only ``request_id`` -- which is the point:
       100 distinct wire requests, one business operation, one key.
    3. Measure with ``await self.measure(target, attempts, operation_ids=[op])``.
    4. Verdict rules:
       * ``DIRECT_NAIVE``  -> always ``OBSERVED``. Record the duplicate count.
       * ``DIRECT_NATIVE`` -> ``PASS`` iff downstream_executions == 1.
       * gateway configs   -> ``PASS`` iff downstream_executions == 1 AND
         gateway_dispatches == 1 AND gateway_debits == 1 AND receipts == 1 AND
         every non-``in_progress`` attempt that succeeded carries the SAME
         receipt_id. Anything else is ``FAIL``.
    5. The observation string MUST NOT use the words "exactly once" about the
       downstream effect. Say what was counted and by which instrument.

    If the requested concurrency produces harness-level errors (SQLite write
    contention, not a product failure), reduce it until the run is clean,
    record the level actually used in ``extra["concurrency"]``, and add a
    limitation saying so. Do not silence a product failure this way: an
    attempt that returns an unexpected *product* status is a finding.
