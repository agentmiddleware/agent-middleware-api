    WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
    -----------------
    1. Arm ``FaultPlan(mode=FaultMode.RESPONSE_LOST_AFTER_EXECUTION,
       operation_id=op, hold_seconds=...)`` on ``target.injector``. The tool
       executes and commits; the response never comes back.
    2. First attempt: submit and let the client time out (direct configs) or
       let the gateway's call timeout fire (gateway configs). Use a client
       timeout comfortably above the gateway's own 2s call timeout so the
       gateway's classification, not the harness's impatience, is what is
       measured.
    3. Retry with ``identity.retry()`` -- same key, new request id.
    4. Measure and record ALL of: downstream execution count (effect ledger),
       gateway dispatch count (fault layer), gateway attempt state, debit
       state, receipt state, and client-visible state for both attempts.
    5. Verdict rules:
       * ``DIRECT_NAIVE``  -> ``OBSERVED``; expect 2 executions. This is the
         duplicate the whole lab exists to show.
       * ``DIRECT_NATIVE`` -> ``PASS`` iff downstream_executions == 1 and the
         retry was answered from the stored result.
       * gateway configs   -> ``PASS`` iff downstream_executions == 1 AND
         gateway_dispatches == 1 AND the first attempt's client-visible state
         is ``explicit_uncertain`` AND the retry returns the SAME receipt id
         without a second dispatch or debit.
    6. CRITICAL honesty rule: the gateway must not claim knowledge it does not
       have. ``FAIL`` if any gateway receipt for this operation records
       ``success``. The correct outcome is ``delivery_uncertain``. State in the
       observation that the charge is retained by design and that the receipt
       does not establish whether the refund reached the customer.
