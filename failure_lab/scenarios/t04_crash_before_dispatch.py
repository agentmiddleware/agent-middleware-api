    NULL immediately before the helper ran, so the aging stands and the forged

    WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
    -----------------
    For each boundary in ``("after_idempotency_begin", "after_prepare",
    "after_debit", "after_attach_charge")`` -- all strictly before the
    one-shot dispatch claim -- run an independent sub-case with its own
    payment id and key:

    1. ``with gateway.crash_at(boundary) as crash:`` submit once. The attempt
       returns ``gateway_process_died``; assert ``crash["fired"]``.
    2. Restart: reconciliation is what a restarted gateway runs. Call
       ``await gateway.backdate_attempts(tenant, seconds=...)`` (the lab
       cannot wait out the real idle window; record this as a limitation),
       then ``await gateway.reconcile(idle_seconds=0)``.
    3. Retry the SAME key, then retry with a FRESH key, and record both.
    4. Determine and record, per boundary: whether any dispatch occurred
       (fault-layer crossings for that operation), what persisted (attempt
       state, debit, refund, receipt), whether the retry dispatched, and the
       resulting accounting state.
    5. Verdict: ``PASS`` iff, for every boundary, downstream_executions == 0
       AND gateway_dispatches == 0 AND the wallet ends with no net debit for
       that operation (refunded or never charged) AND the same-key retry does
       not dispatch. ``FAIL`` on any downstream effect, any net charge for an
       operation that never left the gateway, or a same-key retry that
       dispatches.
    6. Put a per-boundary table in ``extra["boundaries"]``: boundary,
       description (``CRASH_BOUNDARY_DESCRIPTIONS``), dispatches, executions,
       attempt state after reconcile, net debit, receipt outcome, same-key
       retry status, fresh-key retry status.

    Use one fresh operation id per boundary and pass every one of them to
    ``self.measure(..., operation_ids=[...])`` so the totals cover the whole
    sub-case set.
