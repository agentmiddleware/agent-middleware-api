    WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
    -----------------
    ``gateway.database_outage()`` is an async context manager that disposes
    the pool and refuses every new connection for its duration.

    Three sub-cases, each with its own payment id and key:

    ``outage_before_request``  submit entirely inside the outage. Expect a
                               failure with no downstream effect at all.
    ``outage_after_prepare``   hold with ``gateway.hold_at("after_prepare")``,
                               enter the outage while paused, release inside
                               it, exit the outage, then reconcile and retry.
    ``outage_after_claim``     the same, held after the dispatch claim, so the
                               terminal write is what the outage breaks.

    After each sub-case, exit the outage, run ``gateway.backdate_attempts``
    and ``gateway.reconcile(idle_seconds=0)``, then retry the same key.

    Measure and report exactly the PRD's list: lost accepted operations
    (records admitted but left with no terminal state after recovery),
    duplicate dispatches (fault-layer crossings > 1 for one key), inconsistent
    debits (a debit with no receipt and no refund after recovery), corrupted
    state (an attempt row in no valid state), and recovery behavior.

    Verdict: ``PASS`` iff across all sub-cases there is no duplicate dispatch,
    no duplicate downstream execution, no charge left without either a receipt
    or a refund after reconciliation, and every admitted key ends either
    terminal or safely retryable. ``FAIL`` otherwise. An operation that simply
    failed during the outage with nothing dispatched is a correct outcome, not
    a loss -- classify it as ``failed_closed`` rather than ``lost``.

    Record per sub-case rows in ``extra["cases"]`` and the outage's
    ``refused_connections`` count.
