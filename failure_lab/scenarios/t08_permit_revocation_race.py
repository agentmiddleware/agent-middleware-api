    The product must define the authoritative point at which authorization is
    evaluated. This scenario's job is to find that point empirically and
    report it -- not to assert a preferred answer.

    WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
    -----------------
    Four interleavings, each with its own permit, payment id and key:

    ``before_request``   revoke, then submit. Control case.
    ``after_prepare``    hold the in-flight call with
                         ``gateway.hold_at("after_prepare")``, revoke while it
                         is paused, release, observe.
    ``after_attach_charge`` same, held after the debit is linked.
    ``after_claim``      same, held after the one-shot dispatch claim.

    Mechanics for a held case::

        with gateway.hold_at(boundary) as hold:
            task = asyncio.create_task(agent.submit(identity, refund))
            await asyncio.wait_for(hold.reached.wait(), timeout=10)
            await gateway.revoke_permit(tenant, permit_id)
            hold.release.set()
            outcome = await task

    Record per interleaving: the attempt status, whether a dispatch crossed
    the fault layer, downstream executions, net debit, receipt outcome, and
    the permit's final status.

    Verdict: ``PASS`` iff every interleaving lands on one of two coherent
    dispositions and never on an incoherent one.
      * Coherent: (a) denied with zero dispatches, zero executions and no net
        charge; or (b) admitted exactly once -- at most one dispatch, at most
        one execution, exactly one receipt, and the charge matching the
        receipt's outcome.
      * Incoherent, and therefore ``FAIL``: more than one dispatch or
        execution for one key, a charge with no receipt, a receipt with no
        corresponding accounting, or a revoked permit admitting a *second*
        distinct operation after revocation completed.
    Then, in the observation, name the boundary at which revocation stopped
    being effective, and record it in ``extra["authoritative_point"]``.
    Also submit a fresh operation under the revoked permit afterwards and
    confirm it is denied -- revocation must be effective for anything not
    already in flight. Record as ``extra["post_revocation_control"]``.
