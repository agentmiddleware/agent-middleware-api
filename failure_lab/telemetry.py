"""Product analytics that cannot flatter the product.

This module measures whether the diagnostic converts. It is written on the
assumption that most of the traffic through the Failure Lab will be the
authors, their CI, and agents testing the thing -- so the interesting risk is
not privacy theatre, it is a conversion number inflated by its own authors.

Four properties, each enforced by the code rather than by a policy document:

* **Traffic source is a required field with no default.** There is no way to
  emit an event without saying where it came from, and
  :func:`detect_traffic_source` can return ``ci_run``, ``ai_test_agent`` or
  ``unknown`` but never ``human_customer``. A process cannot accidentally
  label itself a customer; a human has to type it.
* **The funnel only ever sees human events.** :func:`funnel` filters before it
  counts, and reports what it dropped and why. Synthetic traffic is not
  "excluded by convention" -- it never reaches the numerator or the
  denominator.
* **Property names are an allowlist.** A denylist is a promise to have thought
  of every field name a future engineer will invent. An allowlist fails closed
  on the one that was not thought of, which is exactly the field that leaks.
  Values are checked for credential, payment and payload shapes on top of
  that.
* **A local JSONL file under the run directory is the only default sink.**
  Sending anything off the machine takes two explicit, non-default arguments,
  one on the sink and one on the client.

:func:`disclosure_text` is generated from the same constants the collector
enforces, so the sentence shown to a person and the behaviour of the code
cannot drift apart.

This module deliberately imports nothing from the rest of the lab: analytics
about the diagnostic must not be able to break the diagnostic, and it must
stay importable while the scenario suite is being edited.

    falls, and that is left visible: it means the surface is not instrumented

What is never recorded: API keys, bearer tokens, signing seeds and control

than dropped quietly, and values that look like credentials, payment details
or payloads are refused the same way.

The subject id is an opaque hash the surface computes before telemetry sees
it. It distinguishes a returning visitor from a new one and identifies nobody.

Traffic source is required on every event and is one of: {", ".join(s.value for s in TrafficSource)}.
Only {TrafficSource.HUMAN_CUSTOMER.value} traffic is counted in any conversion
number; internal, agent and CI traffic is dropped before counting, so it cannot
