"""An independent receipt verifier that imports neither the app nor its SDK.

The PRD is explicit that signature validity must not be displayed as proof
that a business action occurred, and that the gateway's own verification
library must not be the only thing checking the gateway's own signatures.
This module therefore:

* depends on ``cryptography`` and the standard library only -- not on
  ``app`` and not on ``b2a_sdk``;
* is a from-scratch reading of the receipt envelope, so a bug shared between
  the signer and the shipped verifier does not cancel out here;
* returns **three separate claims**, never one boolean.

The three claims
----------------

``SIGNATURE_VALID``
    The Ed25519 signature verifies over the exact ``signing_input`` bytes,
    under the key named *inside* those signed bytes. This says the holder of
    that private key signed this statement. Nothing more.

``ISSUER_TRUST_ESTABLISHED``
    Whether the public key can be trusted to belong to the claimed issuer.
    Fetching it from the same origin being audited does **not** establish
    that: an origin that can serve receipts can serve keys that validate
    forged receipts. Only an out-of-band pin does. The caller says which it
    supplied, and lying to this function is the caller's problem, not a gap
    the function hides.

``DOWNSTREAM_EXECUTION_ESTABLISHED``
    Whether the business action actually happened downstream. A signature can
    never establish this. It is established only by an independent
    observation of the downstream system -- in this lab, the effect ledger --
    supplied by the caller and checked for consistency with the receipt.

Signed bytes versus envelope
----------------------------

The portable bundle carries fields outside the signature (``issuer``,
``kid``, ``canonicalization``, ``keys_url``, ``schema_version``,
``receipt_id``). Editing those does not break the signature, and pretending
otherwise would be the exact overclaim this module exists to prevent.
:func:`field_coverage` reports, field by field, which side of the signature
each one is on -- which is what the tampering scenario measures.
