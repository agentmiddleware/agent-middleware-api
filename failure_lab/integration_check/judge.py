"""The executable judge: it never asks a model anything.

An integration check whose verdict is "the AI said it worked" is worth
nothing, and it is worth less than nothing for a product whose entire pitch is
that an agent's account of its own actions is not evidence. This judge
therefore decides from instruments the candidate cannot reach:

* the **independent effect ledger** -- a SQLite file owned by the simulated
  refund tool, duplicate-tolerant on purpose, which the gateway has no handle
  to. "The customer was refunded twice" is a ``COUNT(*)`` over that file.
* the **fault layer** between the gateway and the tool, which counts every
  execution request that crossed it. "The gateway dispatched once" is observed
  from outside the gateway, never read back from its tables.
* the **gateway's own tables**, used only where the question is genuinely
  about gateway state (does a receipt exist, what outcome did it record), and
  labelled gateway-reported wherever it is rendered.
* the **candidate's source text and its HTTP traffic**, for the questions a
  runtime observation cannot answer: did it verify the receipt with the
  vendor's own verifier, did it reach for the endpoint owned by the party
  being audited.

Exactly one number in the output is taken on the candidate's word --
``documentation_gaps``, because where the docs ran out is only knowable from
inside the attempt -- and it is labelled self-reported in the schema, in the
provenance map and in the rendered report.

Configuration
-------------
The run uses ``D_gateway_naive_downstream``: the gateway in front of a tool
with **no** native idempotency. That choice is the point. Against a correctly
built downstream, an integration that retries under a fresh replay key is
rescued by the tool and looks correct; the naive downstream isolates the
gateway's own guarantee from the downstream's, so an integration that
mis-handles a lost response is caught rather than covered for.

What this does not establish
----------------------------
That a candidate passing here is safe in production. Six assertions over one
tool, one tenant, two injected failures and one deliberate refusal is a floor,
not a certificate.
The crash is a simulated in-process death at an instrumented durable
boundary, not a ``SIGKILL`` of a separate OS process. And a judge that has
never failed anything is not a judge, which is why
``broken_candidate.py`` ships alongside ``reference_candidate.py``.

It also does not establish that the gateway was needed. Only ``D`` is run, so
there is no baseline here at all: a downstream that honours ``operation_id``
as a durable idempotency key removes the same duplicate with no gateway in the
picture, which is configuration ``B_direct_native_idempotency`` in the main
suite and is where that comparison belongs. A pass here says the integration
survived; it says nothing about whether it had to be this integration. That
sentence is in :data:`LIMITATIONS` as well as here, because a caveat that
lives only in a docstring is a caveat nobody reading the result will see.
