"""A correct integration, so the judge is provably not vacuous.

This file exists for one reason: an assertion suite nobody has ever passed is
indistinguishable from an assertion suite nobody *can* pass. Its sibling
``broken_candidate.py`` exists for the opposite reason. Together they bracket
the judge: one passes, one fails, and the difference between them is a single
design decision about where the replay key comes from.

The integration itself is small, and every non-obvious line is a consequence
of one rule:

    **The replay key is derived from the business operation, never from the
    attempt.**

A key minted per attempt makes a retry a second authorization. A key minted
per process makes a restart a second authorization. A key derived from
"refund payment 1041" is the same key in the original process, in the retry,
and in the process that comes back after the crash -- which is the only
reason the gateway can recognise the third call as the same intent as the
first.

Two things this file deliberately does not do:

* It does not verify the receipt with the vendor SDK or with the endpoint the
  issuer serves for that purpose. A verifier supplied by the party being
  audited establishes nothing about that party. It uses
  :mod:`failure_lab.verifier`, which imports neither the application nor its
  SDK and returns three separate claims.
* It does not route around the refusal in operation 3. The permit forbids
  naming the settlement currency; an integration that drops the field and
  tries again has defeated the control it was asked to respect.
