"""Machine-readable traceability from a public claim back to a run.

A sentence on a website is an assertion until something can be pointed at. The
manifest this module emits is that something: one record per scenario, naming
the claim, the test that exercised it, the exact definition the test ran, the
environment, the timestamp, the **observed** verdict, and what the test still
does not cover.

Three rules, and the third is the whole point:

* ``status`` is the observed verdict. It is copied from the result. Nothing in
  this module can turn a FAIL into a PASS, and there is no parameter for it.
* A scenario whose observed verdict differs from its **documented**
  expectation carries ``matches_documented_expectation: false`` and the
  divergence spelled out in ``limitations``. That is true whether the
  surprise is bad (a documented guarantee did not hold) or good (something
  documented as failing now passes) -- an unexpected improvement means the
  documentation and the expectation must be updated together, deliberately,
  not absorbed silently by a manifest.
* :func:`assert_claim_is_supported` refuses a claim unless a record both
  observes PASS *and* matches its documented expectation. A docs or CI check
  calls it and fails the build; that is what stops a claim drifting away from
  the test that was supposed to justify it.

The PRD's record shape is a subset of what is emitted here, and stays one:
``claim``, ``test_id``, ``version``, ``status``, ``environment``,
``tested_at`` and ``limitations`` are always present with those names.
