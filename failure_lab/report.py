"""Turning measurements into a report that can argue against its own product.

Two rules shape every function here, both from the PRD:

* **No risk score.** A single invented number would let a reader skip the
  measurements, and there is no defensible way to weigh "one duplicate refund"
  against "one unresolved operation" on a common scale. Every figure rendered
  here is something an instrument actually counted.
* **The conclusion is descriptive.** It is computed from the counts, and it is
  allowed to say the gateway added nothing. A diagnostic that cannot reach
  that conclusion is marketing with a progress bar.

The comparison is always at least three-way: the existing integration, the
same integration with correct native controls, and native controls plus the
gateway. That is what makes a positive result mean anything -- and what makes
the "you may not need us" result reachable rather than theoretical.
