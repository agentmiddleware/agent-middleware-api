# Elevator Pitch

Pitch copy for Agent Middleware API. Every claim here is bounded by
[`WEDGE.md`](WEDGE.md) and [`SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md`](SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md).
If a version of this pitch ever outruns those two documents, the pitch is wrong,
not the documents.

For the supported evaluation, integration, SDK, security, and pilot paths, use

## One line

> **Authorize one agent action. Charge it once. Prove what happened.**

## Subhead

> One agent action, at most one debit — no matter how many times the agent
> retries under the same accepted key. Verify the receipt without us.

("At most one" is deliberate and matches `CONTEXT.md`:
a crash before dispatch refunds, and a denied call never charges. The guarantee is
never a duplicate charge, not always a charge.)

The debit leads. Offline-verifiable signed receipts are real here and worth
saying, but as of the 2026-08 sweep
([`docs/market-research-2026-08.md`](docs/market-research-2026-08.md)) they are
no longer rare, so they cannot carry the pitch and must never carry a
superlative.

## Ten seconds

Your agent invokes a costly tool and the request times out. Agent Middleware
puts one scoped, budgeted boundary in front of the call: replaying the same
request and accepted idempotency key cannot create another gateway dispatch or
debit; finalized gateway outcomes carry signed receipts.

## Thirty seconds

When an agent's tool call times out, can your current stack prove whether it was
authorized and dispatched, prevent the retry from creating another debit, and
show the economic consequence afterward?

Agent Middleware API is a transaction boundary for metered MCP calls. An agent
uses a wallet-scoped key and an Ed25519-signed permit bound to tool, scope,
budget, and expiry. The gateway records one accepted request key, returns the
original result and signed receipt on an identical replay after finalization,
and rejects changed input under that key. Out-of-scope and over-budget calls
fail before a debit.

Run the [executable proof](README.md#see-it-in-sixty-seconds) locally,
then evaluate the supported vendor-managed, single-tenant pilot with one real
internal tool.

## Two minutes (design-partner version)

**The problem to test.** Give me one tool you are afraid to let an autonomous
agent invoke. If the call times out, can you tell whether the gateway dispatched
it, whether a retry creates another debit, who authorized the economic exposure,
and what evidence survives afterward? Existing IAM, gateway, or logging controls
may already be sufficient; the first conversation must establish that they are
not before this product is proposed.

**The wedge.** Not a general MCP gateway, and not payments. The narrow,
differentiating primitive is **exactly-once economic authorization at the
gateway boundary**:

```text
scoped signed permit -> governed MCP invoke -> wallet charge -> signed receipt
-> ledger -> audit chain -> replay no double charge -> out-of-scope denial
```

**What that buys you.**

- **Budgets that bind.** Decimal wallet balances with row-locked debits. Final
  permit checks and budget reservation happen while the permit row is locked,
  so competing invokes and revoke-versus-invoke races resolve correctly.
- **Same-key replay after finalization.** An identical replay returns the
  original result and receipt with no second gateway dispatch or debit. For the
  configured upstream MCP tool, one persisted chain links the idempotency
  record, permit reservation, ledger debit, dispatch attempt, receipt, and
  audit event.
- **Honest failure accounting.** For the configured upstream MCP tool,
  confirmed pre-dispatch failures and upstream-returned errors are refunded
  and receipted when finalization succeeds. Genuinely ambiguous
  post-dispatch outcomes are marked `delivery_uncertain` and routed to
  fail-closed manual review — never silently redispatched.
- **Portable gateway evidence.** Signed receipts for success, denial, failure,
  *and* `delivery_uncertain`, linked to permits, a verifiable per-wallet hash
  chain, and — where a
  ledger record exists for that outcome — the ledger entry. A pre-dispatch
  denial has no debit to link. This is not a compliance-grade ledger or proof of
  physical work.

**Why believe it.** The proof is executable, not asserted:

| Command | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `make prove-trust-plane` | The full permit → invoke → charge → receipt → replay → deny loop |
| `make dogfood-trust-plane` | The same loop against a tool with a real on-disk side effect |
| `make prove-crash-recovery` | Crash consistency across two OS processes killed at commit boundaries |
| `make red-team-trust-plane` | Adversarial attempts against the boundary |

**The ask.** One partner-owned agent, one real staging tool, and one partner
engineer behind the proxy. Intentionally retry the action, verify the receipt
in the partner's environment, and ask whether removing the boundary would
restore an unacceptable risk. If it does not earn a commercial next step, stop.

## Positioning in one table

| Nearby category | Their center of gravity | Our difference |
|---|---|---|
| MCP trust gateways | Policy and evidence | Wallet debit plus economic idempotency |
| MCP monetization / pay-per-tool | Payment rails | Internal budgets, no settlement claim |
| Enterprise authz for MCP | Who may call | Same-key debit deduplication and receipts for finalized outcomes |
| Agent reliability libraries | Retry safety inside the caller | A boundary the agent cannot route around, and evidence a third party can check |
| Agent audit / compliance layers | Regulatory mapping and exports | The economic consequence, not just the record of the call |

## Who it's for

Platform engineering, AI infrastructure, or security teams that already run
internal agents against MCP-style tools and need a control point *before* the
tool is invoked — and who can bring one real tool to the first conversation.

Concretely, the qualifying shape is **one tool where a duplicate call costs real
money or causes a real side effect**, and where someone outside the engineering
team may have to check what ran. If tool calls are cheap and already idempotent,
this does not pay for itself, and the first conversation should end there.

## Who it isn't for

- Teams wanting governance across every tool and framework at once. That is a
  platform; this is one boundary.
- Teams whose deliverable is a certified compliance report with regulatory
  mappings. Audit-layer products do that; this does not.
- Teams shopping for agent identity or SSO. That is IAM, upstream of this.
- Teams who need retry safety inside code they fully control and whose results
  nobody outside the team has to believe. An in-process library is cheaper and
  is the right answer.

## Objections, answered honestly

**"Isn't this just an API gateway?"** A gateway answers whether a call is
allowed. This binds the authorization to an internal credit budget and signed
receipt, and prevents an identical replay under the same accepted key from
creating another gateway dispatch or debit. The debit and receipt are the
product; the policy check is table stakes.

**"We already have IAM."** Keep it. This is not an IAM replacement and does not
try to be. IAM says an agent may call a tool; this bounds how much that agent
may spend doing it and produces the evidence afterward.

**"Can't we just log tool calls?"** Logs are written by the same system that
made the call and can be rewritten by anyone with database access. Receipts are
signed and chained, so tampering is *evident*. (Evident, not impossible — a
database administrator who can alter both the data and its chain metadata is
inside the trust boundary, and we say so.)

**"What happens when the call is retried?"** For the configured upstream MCP
tool, identical retries under the same accepted idempotency key allow at most
one gateway dispatch and at most one debit. This does not guarantee delivery or
a downstream effect; downstream replay safety also requires the upstream to
honor the forwarded key. Local governed tools have no dispatch state machine
and interrupted calls fail closed into manual review.

A call can commit effects or a debit but return `manual_review_required` with
no receipt if an audit or receipt write fails. Do not retry with a new idempotency key:
that can execute and charge the call again. Reconcile from the ledger and audit
chain as described in [failure semantics](docs/failure-semantics.md).

**"Why not just use an open-source library?"** If your problem is reliability,
do. A decorator library gives you idempotency, timeouts, and budget caps for
free, with no infrastructure. Two things it cannot give you: it protects only
the call sites that import it, so an agent that constructs a call another way is
simply not covered; and an in-process result cache is not evidence anyone
outside your team can check. Buy a boundary when you need those two properties.
Otherwise the library is the correct answer and we will say so.

**"Don't other MCP gateways already sign receipts?"** Yes — several, and at
least one verifies offline without calling its issuer. We do not claim to be
alone here. What no project we surveyed *documents* is binding the debit to the
idempotency record:
one accepted key, at most one dispatch and ledger debit, and a receipt when
finalization succeeds, in a single persisted chain for the configured upstream
tool. (At most one *debit* — a refunded failure correctly writes a second,
compensating ledger entry against that debit.) Several of them enforce budgets
and several dedupe replays; whether any binds the two is unresolved, and we say
so rather than claiming the cell outright. The signature proves what happened;
the ledger link is what makes a duplicate charge impossible rather than merely
detectable.

**"Can these receipts satisfy SOC 2 or the EU AI Act?"** Not on their own, and
we will not say otherwise. A receipt evidences the signed *authorization
decision* and the call's *terminal outcome*, linked to the permit and audit
chain — and shows the record has not been altered since. Only a success receipt
evidences that the call executed and was charged; denial, refunded-failure, and
`delivery_uncertain` receipts evidence exactly those outcomes instead, which is
the point of signing them. A denial is a refusal, not an authorization. Ledger
linkage is present only where a ledger record exists — a debit, or the
compensating entry that reversed it — so `_finalize_governed_denial` takes
`ledger_entry_id` as optional and a pre-dispatch denial carries none. Whether
that satisfies a given control is a determination for the operator's auditor.
We publish no regulatory mappings and hold no certifications. If a mapped
compliance report is the deliverable, an audit-layer product is the better
purchase and we would rather lose the deal than imply coverage we do not have.

**"Why is there no pricing page?"** Because fit is qualified before deployment.
Most of the value of the early deployments is being wrong quickly with a partner
who will say so, and self-serve signup produces installations that cannot be
supported or learned from. The whole loop is runnable locally with no
credentials and no contact with us.

**"What's the maturity?"** Production beta, not production complete. Run the
proofs locally; the supported design-partner posture is vendor-managed and
single-tenant. Read `SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md` before deciding.

## What this pitch must never claim

Do not say, imply, or let a slide suggest:

- Production-ready payments or settlement.
- Compliance-grade ledger storage.
- Full autonomous-economic-actor infrastructure.
- Universal policy enforcement across every agent framework.
- Distributed exactly-once side effects in arbitrary upstream MCP servers.
- A replacement for enterprise IAM, secrets management, or sandbox isolation.
- Byzantine fault tolerance. There is one server, one database, and one
  operator-held signing key — there are no replicas and no consensus.
- That we are the only product doing any of this. Signed receipts, offline
  verification, per-tool policy, and budget caps all exist elsewhere. A
  superlative a prospect can falsify in one search costs more than it buys.
- Compliance coverage, mapping, or readiness for any named framework.

Refusing to overclaim is the product's defining discipline. The pitch inherits
it.
