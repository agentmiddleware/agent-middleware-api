# Wedge: Replay-safe MCP permits and exactly-once debits

Agent Middleware API should not initially sell itself as a full platform for
autonomous economic actors. The credible wedge is narrower:

> Exactly-once gateway authorization, debit, and receipt finalization for
> metered MCP calls.

Or in one line:

> Authorize one agent action. Charge it once. Prove what happened.

Start with the [documentation guide](docs/README.md) for the supported
evaluation, integration, SDK, security, and pilot paths.

**What "exactly-once" means here, precisely.** It is the distributed-systems
term of art for the *deduplication* guarantee — no duplicate dispatch, no
duplicate debit — not a promise that every accepted call results in a charge.
Two paths produce no net debit at all: a crash before dispatch reconciles to a
refund, and an out-of-scope or over-budget call is denied before money moves.
The enforceable claim is **never a duplicate charge, not always a charge.**
Every precise statement of the guarantee below says "at most one" for that
reason. See [`docs/failure-semantics.md`](docs/failure-semantics.md).

The core job is to put one enforceable **economic** boundary between autonomous
agents and tools:

```text
scoped signed permit -> governed MCP invoke -> wallet charge -> signed receipt
-> ledger -> audit chain -> replay no double charge -> out-of-scope denial
```

The loop now has a front door. Two questions an agent has to answer *before*
it can act — "may I?" and "what will it cost?" — are answered in the same
signed, checkable way as the action itself:

```text
permit request -> human approves -> minted permit
signed quote   -> price locked   -> charge honors it
```

Both feed the same loop rather than sitting beside it: the human's decision
mints an ordinary signed permit, and the quote is honored by the ordinary
metered charge. Neither adds a second way to authorize or to spend.

Category language (“MCP trust plane,” “governance gateway”) is occupied. The
differentiating primitive is exactly-once economic authorization at the
gateway boundary: one idempotency key returns the original receipt without a
second gateway dispatch or debit. A remote tool's own side effect is exactly
once only when that tool also honors the forwarded idempotency key.

## Positioning vs nearby products

Stay a **closed-loop credit and delegated-authority** system for internal AI
platform teams—not a general MCP gateway and not merchant settlement.

| Nearby | Their center of gravity | Our difference |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|
| MCP “trust” gateways (e.g. signed receipts + replay) | Policy / evidence | Wallet debit + economic idempotency |
| MCP monetization / pay-per-tool | Payments rails | Internal budgets; no settlement claim |
| Enterprise authz for MCP | Who may call | Meter + receipt + charge-once |
| Agent reliability libraries (in-process decorators) | Retry safety inside the caller | A boundary the agent cannot route around; evidence a third party can check |

Do not pitch as production payments, compliance-grade ledger, or IAM
replacement (see [`SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md`](SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md)).

### Signed receipts are table stakes now (2026-08)

The 2026 competitive sweep in
[`docs/market-research-2026-08.md`](docs/market-research-2026-08.md) verified
that **signed, offline-verifiable receipts are no longer differentiating**.
At least one MCP policy proxy emits Ed25519 receipts verifiable without calling
its issuer, and it carries an IETF Internet-Draft for the format; other projects
ship hash-chained signed receipts alongside policy and HITL.

This does not change the wedge — it sharpens which half of it to lead with.
The row no surveyed project is *documented* as occupying is the **economic**
one:

> One accepted idempotency key produces **at most one** gateway dispatch **to
> the configured upstream MCP tool** and **at most one** ledger debit, linked by
> a single persisted chain, with a receipt on every path that finalizes or
> reconciles — and, on that same upstream path, a genuinely ambiguous
> outcome after the durable send claim becomes a distinct receipted state
> rather than a silent redispatch.

Two qualifications that must travel with that sentence.

**Scope it to the upstream path.** The dispatch state machine
(`prepared → dispatch_claimed → {succeeded, returned_error,
delivery_uncertain, response_rejected}`) covers the **configured upstream MCP
tool**. Immediately before the network send, one nullable
`dispatch_claim_hash` stores the process-local activation's one-shot claim. A
historical `dispatched` row is treated as already sent, never as an available
claim. Once either sent state is durable, a missing trustworthy result becomes
ambiguous and the gateway does not redispatch.

Local governed tools have no attempt row and no ambiguous state; a crash there
fails closed into manual review. The claim fence does not change local-tool
execution or reservations, per-tool call slots, quotes, human approval,
API-key/JWT authentication, or rate limiting. Say "for the configured upstream
tool" — `README.md` already does.

**Verification boundary for this release slice:** focused state-machine,
reconciliation, migration, and PostgreSQL process-kill tests cover the
claim-before-send fence. They do not establish that a deployment is current or
that any downstream effect occurred.

**The signature adds the binding, not the evidence.** For the configured
upstream tool, the receipt's Ed25519 signature covers the ledger entry, the
idempotency record, and the dispatch attempt *together* (local governed tools
have no dispatch-attempt row, so their receipts bind the first two only). That
binding — not the fact of a signature — is the part no surveyed project
documents.

State that as scope, not as exclusivity: several projects enforce budgets and
several dedupe replays, and whether any of them *binds* the two is an open
verification question (`docs/market-research-2026-08.md` §7). Say "no project we
surveyed documents this," never "nobody does."

**Re-tested 2026-08-25** (`docs/market-research-2026-08.md` §9) and the row
still holds — but the neighbourhood got more crowded, not less. Microsoft's
`agent-governance-toolkit` now **ships** offline-verifiable receipts (Ed25519
over RFC 8785 JCS, hash-chained), where §3 had recorded only a proposal;
Pipelock ships mediator-signed receipts; and an independent survey
(arXiv:2606.04193) compares the receipt protocols it names on receiver-side
signing, encryption, transparency logs and discovery — and treats coupling to
settlement as an open opportunity rather than a property any of them has. Useful
receipt-layer context; it does not itself test the debit/idempotency binding.

Treat signed offline receipts as fully commoditized from that date. This is a
re-test on a date, not a permanent result.

Lead with the debit. Cite the signature as supporting evidence, never as the
differentiator, and never as a superlative — see **What Not To Claim Yet**.

## Core User

Platform engineering or AI infrastructure teams that already run internal
agents against MCP-style tools and need a control point before those tools are
invoked.

## First Paid Use Case

Govern and meter internal agent tool calls with wallet budgets, scoped permits,
idempotent retries, signed receipts, and auditable denial.

The first design-partner motion should be one real internal tool behind the
proxy, not a broad migration of every agent workflow.

## Design Partner First Tool

Reference proof tool (local demo only): `trust-plane-echo` via
`make prove-trust-plane` / [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](DEMO_SCRIPT.md).

Partner swap checklist:
[`docs/partner-first-tool-runbook.md`](docs/partner-first-tool-runbook.md).

Partner motion:

1. Keep `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=false` in the partner environment.
2. Configure **one** internal Streamable HTTP MCP tool through the upstream
   environment variables (do not mount AWI/media/etc.).
3. Issue a wallet-scoped permit for that tool only.
4. Walk permit → invoke → charge → receipt → replay → out-of-scope deny.
5. Stop. Do not expand surface until that loop is trusted in their stack.

## What Is Core

- Wallet-scoped API keys.
- MCP discovery and invocation.
- Signed permits for tool scope, wallet binding, key binding, budget, expiry,
  and nonce.
- A request path for authority an agent cannot mint itself: the agent states
  scope, budget, and justification; a human decides; the middleware mints the
  permit from the reviewed terms.
- Signed, single-use price quotes that the metered charge honors, so an agent
  can know a call's cost before committing to it.
- Idempotency keys for permit issuance and governed invokes.
- Ledger-backed wallet charging.
- Signed receipts for governed tool attempts.
- Tamper-evident wallet audit chains.
- Explicit denial reasons for out-of-scope or invalid governed attempts.
- A persisted remote-dispatch state that distinguishes confirmed outcomes from
  delivery uncertainty.

## What The Current Proof Shows

- A permit can bind one agent wallet to one allowed MCP tool and budget.
- A governed MCP invoke can validate that permit before the gateway dispatches
  the tool call.
- A successful governed invoke can charge the wallet and write a ledger entry.
- The response can include a signed receipt linked to permit, ledger, and audit
  identifiers.
- The audit chain can be verified after the fact.
- Replaying the same governed invoke can return the same receipt without a
  duplicate gateway dispatch or debit.
- A request outside the permit scope can be denied with a concrete reason.
- An agent with no authority can ask a human for a scoped, budgeted permit, and
  the permit that gets minted carries exactly the terms the human reviewed.
- A signed quote can fix the price of one call, and the charge honors it even
  after the tool's registered price moves.

## What Is Proof Surface

AWI, browser automation, content generation, oracle crawls, media utilities,
IoT bridges, red-team services, RTaaS, telemetry auto-PR, and sandbox demos are
proof surfaces. They may exercise the control plane, but they do not define the
product until they consume the same permit, receipt, idempotency, and audit
primitives.

**Freeze list (do not expand):** [`docs/PROOF_SURFACES.md`](docs/PROOF_SURFACES.md)
— mirrors `PROOF_SURFACE_ROUTERS` in `app/main.py`, accept/freeze stubs, and
agent rules.

## What To Freeze

- New proof-surface features and ungated HTTP demos (see
  [`docs/PROOF_SURFACES.md`](docs/PROOF_SURFACES.md)).
- Broad multi-tool migrations before one partner tool is live.
- KMS, settlement, transparency logs, and non-MCP adapters (see
  [`SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md`](SECURITY_LIMITATIONS.md)).

Wrap-and-anchor evidence is frozen with that transparency-log line. The
intended later slice — if a named partner requires it — wraps the existing
receipt claims as an in-toto/DSSE predicate, signs under a Sigstore or
SPIFFE **gateway** identity (not the agent wallet), and appends the
statement hash to Rekor or a SCITT transparency service. Unfreeze only when
that partner cannot trust `/.well-known/trust-keys.json` on this origin, or
needs Alice and Bob to see the same receipt for the same id. Inclusion
proofs address equivocation, not completeness: a log does not prove an
unpublished action did not occur, and it does not make a dishonest gateway
honest. Lead with the debit; cite that stack as supporting evidence, never as
the product. The ledger stays the source of truth; a log is not a second
debit system.

Production-like deploys must keep `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=false`.

## What Not To Claim Yet

- Production-ready payments or settlement.
- Compliance-grade ledger storage.
- Full autonomous economic actor infrastructure.
- Universal policy enforcement across every agent framework.
- Distributed exactly-once side effects in arbitrary upstream MCP servers.
- Proof that a durable gateway dispatch claim caused any downstream effect.
- Quotes as a pricing or settlement product. A quote fixes what this gateway
  will debit from an internal wallet for one call; it is not a market price, a
  vendor commitment, or an invoice.
- Uniqueness superlatives — “the only gateway that…”, “no competitor offers…”.
  Signed receipts, offline verification, per-tool policy, and budget caps all
  exist elsewhere; a superlative that a reader can falsify in one search costs
  more credibility than the claim buys.
- Compliance mapping to the EU AI Act, Colorado AI Act, ISO 42001, or SOC 2.
  Receipts may be *one input* an operator's auditor accepts; that is the
  operator's determination, not ours. No mappings, no certifications, no
  “compliance-ready.”
- Permit requests as an approval-workflow product. The decision is delegated to
  Sentinel and the surface is one ask and one poll — it is not a replacement
  for an access-request or change-management system.
- A replacement for enterprise IAM, secrets management, or sandbox isolation.
