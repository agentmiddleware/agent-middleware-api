"""Governed Pydantic AI middleware over the in-process permit validator.

``governed_tool`` wraps an async function as a client-side stub for a
middleware-registered MCP tool. Each call is screened by the session's
:class:`~b2a_sdk.edge_client.LocalPermitValidator` — a locally-denied call
raises ``b2a_sdk.errors.PermitDeniedError`` without touching the server —
and then dispatched through the governed loop
(``AgentMiddlewareClient.invoke_tool``: permit, caller-owned idempotency
key, signed receipt). The wrapped function's body never runs locally; its
name, signature, and docstring describe the tool to the framework.

Honesty note: the local checks are an optimistic latency mirror. The
governed loop is the path; the server's ``authorize_and_reserve`` remains
authoritative and can still deny a call the local mirror allowed.

This module works with NEITHER framework installed: the generic
``governed_tool`` decorator has no framework dependency, and only
:func:`as_pydantic_ai_tool` imports ``pydantic_ai`` — inside the function,
following the pattern in ``framework_integrations/tools.py``.
