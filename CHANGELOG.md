# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — planned v1.3.0

The next release consolidates the accumulated trust-plane and public-product
work as `v1.3.0`. Create that tag only from the exact commit that passes the
full release gate; do not backfill a final `v1.2.0` tag.

### 🧩 OpenAI wrapper: the model's `tool_call.id` is the operation identity

- **`wrappers/openai-agent-middleware` drives OpenAI function calling and the
  Responses / Agents SDK through the governed permit → invoke → receipt
  loop, and never invents a replay key.** Every tool call OpenAI emits
  carries an id that is assigned once and lives in the transcript the
  application already persists, so a retry of the same call after a dropped
  connection, a crashed worker, or a resumed run carries the same id. The
  runner derives the trust plane's `Idempotency-Key` from it (`oai-<id>`),
  writes that derivation to an `OperationKeyStore` before the first network
  call, and refuses a tool call that has no id rather than minting a key
  that would turn the retry into a second charged action. One permit is
  issued per `(run_id, tool)` under a stable key with its `expires_at`
  recorded before the request, so a retried permit request is byte-identical
  and the server replays it instead of rejecting it. Source-only like the
  other wrappers, no `openai` dependency (it accepts the SDK's tool-call
  objects and plain dicts), and not exercised against a live OpenAI model
  in this repository's CI. `tests/test_openai_wrapper_trust_loop.py` drives
  the runner against the real application in-process: a retried tool call,
  including from a resumed process on the same store, returns the original
  signed receipt, and the wallet is debited once per distinct tool call.
- **`tests/test_mcp_legacy_envelope_validation.py` docstring corrected.** It
  listed a missing `jsonrpc` member as refused; only a stated version other
  than `"2.0"` is refused, and the version-less legacy envelope stays
  accepted, as the module's own control test pins.

### 🔒 Transport hardening on top of the replay-key, envelope, and strict-parse fixes

- **Every explicitly supplied key source is read.** `POST /mcp` treats a
  legacy-shaped `params.mcpContext.idempotency_key` as a key source
  (validated and conflict-checked like the header and `_meta`) instead of
  silently running such a call un-keyed twice; a non-object `mcpContext`
  is invalid params. An `Idempotency-Key` header is decoded as UTF-8 and
  nothing else, on the MCP and governed AWI surfaces alike: a non-ASCII key
  no longer conflicts with the identical key sent in the body or trips the
  control-character check on its continuation bytes, and a header whose
  bytes are not UTF-8 is refused (`idempotency_key_not_utf8`) rather than
  read as latin-1, so two different wire values can never alias to one key.
- The adapter recognises a JSON-RPC envelope by its protocol members
  (`method`, `jsonrpc`) and otherwise unwraps only an object with no
  top-level tool `name`, so a `tools/call` whose params contain a key named
  `params` is no longer misrouted while an envelope that also carries a
  stray top-level `name` still is one. A legacy REST invoke whose
  `arguments.wallet_id` is not a string is a 400, not a validation error
  raised inside the handler.
- Site: the machine-pointer files (`llm.txt`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`)
  render the published receipt's issue date from the bundle at build time
  like the HTML pages do, instead of describing it as live gateway proof;
  the optional booking-block markers accept CRLF line endings and a closing
  marker at end of file. (`tests/test_mcp_transport_hardening.py`,
  `docs/failure-semantics.md` "What counts as a key".)

### 🔒 A present-but-unusable replay key is refused, never replaced

- **`POST /mcp` no longer generates a key on the caller's behalf when the
  caller sent one it cannot use.** An `io.agentmiddleware/idempotency_key`
  metadata entry or `Idempotency-Key` header that is not a string, blank,
  longer than 128 characters, or carrying control characters used to fall
  through to a fresh generated key, so identical retries carrying the bad key
  executed and were charged again (an independent review measured two debits
  for one intended action). Such a key is now refused with invalid params
  (`-32602`) and a machine-readable `reason_code` before a permit is minted,
  anything is metered, or anything is dispatched. The limit is 128 because
  that is the width of the durable `idempotency_records.idempotency_key`
  column (and the SDK's own bound); the metadata parser's former 256 could
  never be stored on PostgreSQL.
- **Two key sources must agree.** A header and a body key that differ are
  refused as `idempotency_key_conflict` instead of one silently winning; the
  same key in both places (what the Python SDK sends) keeps working.
  Repeated `Idempotency-Key` headers follow the same rule.
- **Absent stays absent.** No key anywhere, or a JSON `null` entry, is still
  an un-keyed call: a generated key on `/mcp`, `idempotency_key_required` on
  a governed `/mcp/messages` call. The contract is now pinned by tests in
  both directions and documented in `docs/failure-semantics.md`.
- **Legacy `POST /mcp/messages` validates the JSON-RPC envelope before reading
  it.** A body that is an array, `null`, a string, or a number, a non-string
  `method`, array `params`, a non-object `mcpContext` or `arguments`, or a
  non-string identifier inside `mcpContext` used to reach `.get` and surface
  as HTTP 500. They now return a controlled JSON-RPC error (`-32600` or
  `-32602`) with a safe echoed `id` (`null` when the request's id is not a
  string, number, or null), and — proven with a valid permit in hand —
  execute nothing and debit nothing. The same shape check runs inside the
  governed adapter seam, so every transport gets it. The REST
  `/mcp/tools/{service_id}/invoke` path applies the same key rules and
  answers HTTP 400.
- **The governed AWI HTTP routes hold the same contract.**
  `begin_awi_http_governed` — behind `POST /v1/awi/execute`,
  `passkey/challenge`, `passkey/verify`, `dom/sync`, `rag/index`, and
  `rag/query` — refused only an absent or blank `Idempotency-Key`, then
  stored `key.strip()` as the replay identity, so `' k'` and `'k'` collapsed
  into one record and the second call replayed the first receipt instead of
  running; it applied no length cap, so a key wider than the 128-character
  store column passed permit validation and reached the database; and it
  read the header through a single-value parameter, so a second line
  carrying a different key was never seen (adversarial verification of the
  contract above, 2026-09). Every header line now goes through the shared
  `resolve_client_idempotency_key` and the key is used verbatim: no header
  is still `idempotency_key_required`; a present-but-unusable one, or two
  lines that disagree, is HTTP 400 `invalid_idempotency_key` with the same
  `reason_code`, `source`, and `remediation` fields plus the governed
  `tool`, ahead of permit validation and before any record is written. A
  blank header is therefore now `idempotency_key_blank` rather than
  `idempotency_key_required`. Trimming was dropped on purpose: the Python
  SDK trims client-side before sending and no first-party caller sends a
  padded key, so server-side trimming only merged distinct client keys. The
  handlers declare the header as a list so FastAPI delivers every line
  (these proof-surface routes are not part of the exported core
  `docs/openapi.json`, which is unchanged). `tests/test_awi_http_governance.py`
  covers the absent, blank, over-long, control-character, conflicting, and
  padded cases beside a valid-key replay control at the store width.
- **Both MCP transports parse the body strictly, so a call can no longer
  charge and then fail to answer.** Python's parser accepts `NaN`,
  `Infinity` and `1e400`, and a JSON `"\ud800"` escape decodes to a lone
  surrogate; the response serializer refuses all of them — *after* the
  governed tool had run and the wallet had been charged, so the caller saw
  HTTP 500 for a call that happened and a keyed retry 500'd again on the
  replay (an independent security review reproduced the surrogate case on
  both `POST /mcp/messages` and `POST /mcp`). `POST /mcp/messages` now
  reads the raw body, applies the standard endpoint's 100-level nesting
  guard (shared from one definition; deep nesting previously raised
  `RecursionError` → 500 on Python 3.11), parses with non-finite numbers
  refused, rehearses the response encode to catch unpaired surrogates, and
  answers HTTP 400 `Invalid JSON` — the same status a non-UTF-8 body now gets
  instead of an unhandled `UnicodeDecodeError`. An envelope that states a
  `jsonrpc` version other than `"2.0"` (a `"1.0"` request used to reach
  dispatch) is `-32600`; a version-less envelope is still accepted, as this
  route always has. `POST /mcp` runs the same strict parse on the raw bytes it already
  buffers for the depth guard: an unechoable body is `-32600` and a
  non-UTF-8 body is `-32700`, both HTTP 400, where the SDK previously
  answered 500; syntax errors are still the SDK's own `-32700`.
- **`GET /health` now publishes `build_provenance`** alongside `commit_sha`,
  the same field `/health/dependencies` already carried, so the liveness
  probe alone can tell a trustworthy-but-behind deployment from a stale stamp.
  `docs/deployment-verification-checklist.md` records the 2026-09-05 reading
  (production at `2880ca7`, `stamped`, eleven commits behind `main`) and the
  steps that must precede any "this fix is live" claim.

### 🌐 Site: pilot intake is email-first

- **The primary CTA on every page is "Start a pilot by email"** (the
  configured `PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`); the secondary is "Run the local proof".
  The pilot section explains the three things to send in plain terms — the
  tool or action, what goes wrong on retry, and how you currently check
  whether the action happened — and asks for synthetic or redacted examples
  only. A call is offered only when a scenario needs one.
- **`PUBLIC_BOOKING_URL` is optional.** The build gates on the accountable
  name and monitored address alone. A configured booking link renders as a
  secondary "Book a call if your scenario needs one" link inside
  `<!-- booking:start -->` … `<!-- booking:end -->` blocks; without one the
  blocks are removed whole, so no page ships an empty `href`, an unresolved
  token, or a `booking_click` hook. A supplied link is validated exactly as
  before.
- **The published receipt is described as what it is.** Both the landing
  proof section and `/proof/` name the day the sample receipt was issued
  (read from the receipt's own signed claims at build time), call it a
  historical sample, and say that verifying it is not a test of the
  deployment running today. The verifier panel is titled "published sample
  receipt" rather than "live receipt".

### 🌐 Site: the arcade treatment steps back to the footer

- **The public site drops the full 8-bit chrome.** `site/styles.css` is
  rewritten as the "ledger night" system: Instrument Serif headlines,
  Libre Franklin card titles, Public Sans body, IBM Plex Mono for every
  label and receipt row; hairline borders, soft corners and soft shadows;
  no CRT scanlines or vignette, no hard-offset shadows, no stepped
  transitions, no pixel upscaling of the particle field, and font
  antialiasing back on. The palette moves from CRT purple to a deep navy
  ink with the same gold seal accent; the operator index, the approval
  card, the favicon, the social card and the particle field's ground are
  re-resolved to the new tokens so the palette guards still hold.
- **The waiting room keeps its cabinet.** The pixel tokens `arcade.css`
  is built on (`--px`, `--edge`, the hard shadows, the pixel display face,
  the zero radius) are now declared on `.arcade-overlay` itself, so the
  arcade is unchanged behind its `HUMANS: PRESS START` control — which is
  the one place the page still wears the pixel face.
- **The governed loop is shown as evidence, not described.** The homepage
  hero pairs the headline with a terminal panel replaying permit → invoke →
  replay → verify, and the "Governed path" section is the full annotated
  transcript. Every line is rendered at build time from
  `site/proof/transcript.json`, which `scripts/record_site_transcript.py`
  (`make site-transcript`) records from a real `make prove-trust-plane` run
  with credentials redacted; the proof section prints the SDK verifier's
  real stdout for the published receipt, and the build refuses a transcript
  whose verdict is for a different receipt than the one published.
- **Resolved surfaces follow.** `static/dashboard.html` sheds its inlined
  Press Start 2P and pixel chrome for the same hairline system on system
  fonts; `social-card.svg`/`.png` are redrawn in the page's own faces; the
  pixel font is no longer preloaded; the `?v=gateway-14` cache token is
  bumped on every page.

### 🧹 One supported production configuration path

- **Selected Railway API settings now have a reviewable IaC owner.** The
  deprecated root Config as Code file is replaced by
  `.railway/railway.ts`, pinned to Railway SDK `3.11.0`. Its stable named
  partial owns the API build, health check, placement, domain, and variable-key
  presence; it omits the stale GitHub source binding and all data/partner
  resources, and preserves all 30 existing API variable names plus the
  optional `SENTINEL_API_KEY` name without storing or creating their values.
  Restart fields deliberately remain provider-owned: Railway CLI `5.43.3`
  re-proposes the documented `ON_FAILURE`/10 defaults when they are explicit.
  Omitting them removes that known explicit-field false drift and is the
  candidate convergent representation, but it accepts provider-default risk.
  A fresh disposable plan/apply/second-plan proof remains required before
  activation; CLI/SDK upgrades require repeat validation, and any actual
  restart delta remains an abort. An offline fail-closed graph check now runs
  in the trust release gate under Node 24. Production plan/apply and source
  disconnection remain a separately authorized maintenance operation;
  `railway up` continues to own exact-SHA application deployment only.
- **Retired `.env.production` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`.** The tracked
  templates were not used by Railway and no longer satisfied the production
  trust contract: they omitted signing material, migrations, exact build
  provenance, and the supported private-service posture. Production now has
  one documented source of truth: the repository Dockerfile deployed from an
  exact SHA with configuration and secrets held in Railway service variables.
- **Regression coverage keeps production-looking secret files out of the
  repository.** The retired paths and legacy Railway Config as Code filenames
  are ignored, the onboarding contract pins their absence, and focused guards
  require every tracked IaC variable to remain `preserve()`-only. The remaining
  Compose file is explicitly local-development-only and no longer advertises a
  commented production stack.

### 🔎 `permit verify` names missing action context, and the live loop proves it

- **`POST /v1/permits/verify` asked without `wallet_id` or `tool` no longer
  answers `permit_wallet_mismatch`.** The endpoint decides an action, so it
  evaluated the absent fields as empty strings and landed on a binding reason
  that reads as "this permit is not yours" — to the permit's own subject. It
  now answers `permit_verify_context_missing` with `details.missing` naming the
  fields that were left out. Reasons that do not depend on the missing context
  (`permit_not_found`, `permit_expired`, `permit_revoked`) are unchanged, as is
  the 403 that keeps an unrelated caller from reading a permit by id.
- **`scripts/live_loop_proof.py` now covers permit verification.** The run adds
  a `verify` stage before the invoke (the granted action must verify
  `valid: true`) and a `verify-scope` check before the denial (the same
  endpoint must refuse a *registered* tool the permit does not name, with
  `permit_tool_not_allowed`). An unregistered tool name proves nothing here:
  "no such tool" is not "your permit does not cover it".

### 🔒 Production refuses a SQLite `DATABASE_URL` at boot

- **The premise behind eleven of the twelve audit findings no longer holds.**
  Those findings were live because `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` is a silent no-op on
  SQLite and nothing refused SQLite in production. `validate_trust_mode_config`
  now refuses a SQLite `DATABASE_URL` — file *and* in-memory spellings — in
  production-like environments, and refuses an empty one, since wallets,
  permits, receipts, and the ledger are relational and `get_engine()` returns
  `None` without it.
- This is a **separate control** from the `STATE_BACKEND` guard added in #304.
  That one governs the key/value durable-state store; this one governs the ORM
  engine the money and permit paths actually write through. The gap between
  them was reachable: `STATE_BACKEND=redis` with a `REDIS_URL` satisfies the
  state check completely while `DATABASE_URL` stays SQLite, which is precisely
  the posture `tests/test_trust_mode_guardrails.py::test_a_redis_state_backend_does_not_excuse_a_sqlite_database_url`
  now pins.
- Local development is untouched: SQLite remains the standard value outside
  production-like environments, and a regression test asserts it stays
  accepted there.

### 🔒 A dry-run session no longer confirms another tenant's session exists

- **`403` where a `404` was due.** Every `/v1/billing/dry-run/session`
  endpoint looked the session up first and checked wallet access second, so a
  caller holding any valid wallet-scoped key got `404` for an invented session
  id and `403` for a real one — enough to tell them apart with no access at
  all. The `403` body also carried the session's *owning* `wallet_id`,
  disclosing another tenant's wallet id outright.
- A session the caller may not see now answers exactly as one that does not
  exist, on all five endpoints that accept a session id (`GET`, `DELETE`,
  `commit`, `revert`, and `dry-run/charge`). Authorized callers are
  unaffected — a regression test pins that the owner still reads its own
  session.
- Session ids are UUID4 and cannot be enumerated, so exploiting this needed an
  id learned elsewhere (a log, a trace, a shared URL).

### 🧾 Metering and velocity hardening

- **A rejected charge no longer decrements a velocity period it never
  contributed to.** The hourly and daily counters roll over independently, and
  a rollover between the increment and its reversal left the reversal taking
  credits off the *new* period's total. Each counter is now reversed under the
  period marker it was recorded against, separately, so a rolled daily window
  cannot suppress an hourly reversal that is still owed. The direction is the
  point: an over-count throttles a caller who did not spend and heals at the
  next rollover, while an under-count silently raises the effective spend cap
  and delays the anomaly auto-freeze.
- **`/v1/billing/charge` answers 404 for an unknown wallet** instead of letting
  `WalletNotFoundError` escape as a 500 — the six other endpoints in that
  router already did.
- **Negative and zero `units` are refused at the billing engine.** A negative
  `units` made `charge_amount` negative, and the guarded debit then read
  `balance >= charge_amount` as trivially true and applied
  `balance - charge_amount` — *raising* the balance. Reproduced against the
  unfixed engine: a wallet at 100 charged `units=-5` ended at 110, with a
  ledger entry recording `action="debit", amount=+10`, so the audit trail
  agreed it was a charge. The router refused it through `gt=0`; the governed
  MCP path and the SDK do not pass through the router.
- **The dry-run endpoint validates `units` too.** `POST /v1/billing/dry-run/charge`
  has two branches: with a session id it calls `ShadowLedger.simulate_charge`
  directly and never reaches `BillingEngine.charge`, so the engine guard did
  not cover it; without one it reached the engine and the guard escaped as a
  500. `SimulatedChargeRequest.units` now carries the same `gt=0` and
  `allow_inf_nan=False` constraints as the real charge, refusing both branches
  with a 422 before either is chosen.
- **Non-finite `units` are refused**, at the query boundary
  (`allow_inf_nan=False`) and again in `BillingEngine.charge`, which the
  governed MCP path and the SDK reach without passing the router. `gt=0` does
  not exclude an infinite float, and one reaching a write would put a
  non-finite amount in the ledger that no reconciliation can remove.
- **Four guarded writes from the previous release gained the regression tests
  they shipped without**: the `refund_charge` credit, `_apply_refund`, the
  operator refund's permit release, and the Stripe fiat clawback. Each was
  confirmed to fail against the read-modify-write it replaced.
- Tests that force a concurrent writer into an open transaction are now skipped
  when `DATABASE_URL` names a real-locking engine. They depend on the lock
  being a no-op; against a real one they would hang rather than fail.

### 🔌 Standard `/mcp` endpoint now served by the official MCP SDK

- **The opt-in `POST /mcp` endpoint no longer hand-rolls JSON-RPC.** The
  official MCP python SDK's stateless Streamable HTTP transport (JSON-response
  mode, one fresh transport per request) now owns the entire protocol
  surface: `initialize` and protocol-version negotiation (through
  `2025-11-25`), notifications, `ping`, JSON-RPC framing, parse errors,
  Accept/Content-Type validation, and error envelopes.
- The trust plane is unchanged and stays this codebase's only contribution to
  the endpoint: API-key/JWT auth and origin validation at the HTTP layer, and
  a `tools/call` handler that mints the bounded single-tool permit and runs
  the same governed permit → meter → exactly-once dispatch → signed receipt
  pipeline, preserving the JSON-RPC governance error codes (`-32001`,
  `-32003`, `-32004`, `-32005`) and receipt-bearing error `data`.
- Signed receipts now also ride the spec's extension point —
  `result._meta["io.agentmiddleware/receipt"]` — alongside the existing
  top-level `receipt` field, so standards-compliant clients that strip
  unknown result fields still get the receipt.
- Added an external end-to-end proof (`tests/test_minimal_path_e2e.py`): a
  real uvicorn process in strict trust mode, driven over HTTP by the official
  MCP SDK client, proving one governed tool call is authorized by a
  server-minted permit, charged exactly once for an idempotency key, replay
  answered with the original receipt, and the receipt verifiable via
  `/v1/receipts/verify`.

### 🌐 Public product direction

- Canonical public origins are `https://www.thisisatest.tech/` for the
  buyer-first marketing site and `https://api.thisisatest.tech` for API and
  machine discovery.
- Public product naming is **Agent Middleware API**. Contact metadata is omitted
  until an accountable display name and monitored address are configured.
- The broad production-beta roadmap and launch-thread draft are explicitly
  superseded by a one-tool design-partner pilot.
- Added a buyer-first, contact-gated marketing build with canonical metadata,
  robots/sitemap, favicon, social preview, and non-PII funnel analytics.
- Published one self-issued live `partner.echo` portable receipt plus its
  public-key snapshot and CI-covered offline tamper checks. The proof is
  explicitly not customer traction or independent key-identity attestation.
- Replaced the fabricated dashboard telemetry and parse-only verifier with a
  truthful public status/evidence index that never requests browser API keys.
- Added exact build commit metadata to both health endpoints and labeled
  process-local call counters separately from durable dispatch history.
- Documented the supported enterprise pilot boundary: one vendor-managed
  Railway project and dedicated API, PostgreSQL, Redis, origin, signing key,
  and administrator set per low-sensitivity design partner. Shared SaaS,
  customer-VPC/BYOC, and regulated production data remain out of scope.

### 🔬 Competitive research, and the positioning correction it forced

- **The interop question now has running code.**
  `examples/acta_receipt_interop.py` (plus `tests/test_acta_receipt_interop.py`,
  8 tests) transcodes a signed portable receipt into the ScopeBlind ACTA
  receipt envelope as a custom `agentmiddleware:governed_invoke` type — inner
  production signature verified over the exact `signing_input` bytes, outer
  Ed25519-over-JCS envelope, economic linkage as first-class fields, floats
  and unverified or linkage-less bundles refused. Deliberately an experiment
  in `examples/`, not a product surface; shipping it remains a product call.
- **The demand question now has an instrument.**
  `docs/partner-interview-script.md`: a past-tense-only discovery script with
  an incident-first structure, a commitment test priced in engineer-afternoons
  rather than opinions, a per-call scoring table, and a decision rule
  committed before the interviews so five calls produce a verdict.

- **Second research pass (2026-08-15) answered two of the open questions.**
  The protect-mcp receipt draft
  (`draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts`) was read directly: it is an individual
  submission with no IETF standing, its -02 revision adds a
  `spending_authority` receipt type (the closest competitor is standardizing
  *spend* evidence, though still nothing binding a debit to an idempotency
  record), and its namespaced types plus Merkle commitment mode make emitting
  our receipts in its envelope structurally cheap — interop is now a costed
  option rather than an unknown. Problem evidence was upgraded from one
  reproduction to a **confirmed production incident** of silent retry
  re-execution (`langchain-ai/langgraph#7417`, LangGraph Cloud, "2–3x
  redundant work and cost"), a second framework with the same documented gap
  (`crewAIInc/crewAI#5802`), and a first-hand practitioner report of one
  request producing four sends — while still recording that no duplicated
  *payment charge* in production is publicly confirmed, and that none of this
  is willingness-to-pay evidence. See `docs/market-research-2026-08.md` §8.

- Added `docs/market-research-2026-08.md`: MCP-native competitive set, market
  sizing, and problem evidence, each row carrying an explicit verification
  level. `stripe/ai#402` — a third-party issue report, with a reproduction, of
  agent-level retries creating duplicate charges — was read directly and is now
  the strongest external evidence for the wedge. It is a reported reproduction,
  not a confirmed production incident, and is labeled as such.
- **Signed, offline-verifiable receipts are no longer differentiating**, and the
  docs now say so. At least one MCP policy proxy ships Ed25519 receipts
  verifiable without calling its issuer, with an IETF Internet-Draft for the
  format. `WEDGE.md` and `ELEVATOR_PITCH.md` now lead with the economic claim
  instead: one accepted idempotency key, one dispatch, one ledger debit, one
  receipt, in a single persisted chain.
- `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` gained a scope note and §9. Its "no competitor
  offers this" statements were true against Stripe/AWS/Okta and are false
  against the MCP-native set; both facts are now recorded rather than edited
  away.
- Added two prohibitions to `WEDGE.md`'s never-claim list: uniqueness
  superlatives, and compliance mapping to any named framework.
- Added `/compare/` to the marketing site — a named comparison including the
  rows this product loses, a build-vs-buy section against in-process
  reliability libraries, explicit fit/poor-fit criteria, and FAQ answers on
  compliance and the absence of pricing. A test asserts the page keeps naming
  alternatives, keeps conceding ground, and never acquires a superlative or a
  compliance guarantee. Static asset cache token bumped to `v=gateway-3`.

### 🧾 Denials an agent can act on, and trust reads a wallet can do itself

- **Permit denials now carry `details`** — the evaluated constraint and its
  numbers: `required_credits`/`remaining_credits` on a budget denial,
  `limit`/`calls_made` on a call-cap denial, `requested_tool`/`allowed_tools`,
  `missing_scopes`, `expired_at`, and so on. Surfaced on both governed
  transports (`detail.details` and JSON-RPC `error.data.details`), on
  `POST /v1/permits/verify`, on governed AWI actions, and as `denial_details`
  in the signed audit metadata. New terminal denial receipts also sign an
  optional stable `reason_code`, while richer details remain adjacent API and
  audit context and legacy receipts remain valid. See
  [`docs/denial-details.md`](docs/denial-details.md).
- **Offline verification now displays signed denial reasons.** Portable
  receipt exports include `reason_code` in `signing_input` only when present;
  successful and legacy receipts omit it. `b2a-verify-receipt` prints the
  verified reason without trusting an unsigned response field.
- **Binding mismatches stay silent about values.** `permit_wallet_mismatch` and
  `permit_key_mismatch` report only which binding failed — a caller that has
  not proved it is the subject learns nothing about the wallet or key the
  permit belongs to. Forbidden-field denials echo the field name, never its
  value.
- **Trust reads that required an operator key are now wallet self-service**,
  scoped to the caller: `GET /v1/permits` with no `wallet_id`,
  `GET /v1/audit/events` (including `summary=true`), `GET /v1/audit/summary`,
  `POST /v1/audit/verify-chain` with no wallet, and
  `GET /v1/receipts/reconciliation/refunds`. Naming another wallet is still
  refused, operator keys still get the cross-tenant view, and the refund
  **retry** stays operator-only because it moves money.

### 🔭 Self views for the two new front-door steps, and the positioning to match

- **Added `GET /v1/me/permit-requests` and `GET /v1/me/quotes`** — the calling
  wallet's own outstanding asks and unspent price commitments, alongside the
  existing `/v1/me/permits`, `/v1/me/receipts`, and `/v1/me/audit/events`.
  Listing permit requests is strictly read-only: it never advances a decision,
  so an agent can survey what it is waiting on without paging a human or
  minting a permit as a side effect of looking. `/v1/me/quotes?status=active`
  lists the spendable ones, and an unspent quote past its window reads as
  `expired` here exactly as the invoke path would treat it.
- **Positioning updated to cover the front door** — `WEDGE.md` (the ask/price
  steps, what they prove, and what not to claim about them), `README.md`
  (implemented table, API surfaces, docs index, governed call shape),
  `ELEVATOR_PITCH.md`, and the landing copy in `site/`.
- The permit-request API projection moved into the service layer so the poll
  endpoint and the wallet's own view report a request identically.

### 💵 Signed quotes — a price an agent can rely on

- **Added `POST /v1/quotes` and `GET /v1/quotes/{id}`** (`app/routers/quotes.py`):
  an agent asks what one call of a tool costs and gets a signed statement of
  the price, valid for `QUOTE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 600). Backed by the new
  `quotes` table (migration `031_quotes`). See
  [`docs/signed-quotes.md`](docs/signed-quotes.md).
- **The quote locks the price.** Passing `mcpContext.quote_id` on a governed
  invoke charges the quoted credits even if the tool's registered price has
  moved since — in either direction. The permit budget is checked against the
  quoted price too, so the permit sees what will actually be charged.
- **Single use.** A quote is spent by an atomic `active → consumed` UPDATE that
  also requires the window to still be open, so concurrent invokes cannot both
  ride one quote. An invoke that consumed a quote but could not charge returns
  it to `active`.
- **Invalid quotes deny rather than silently reprice** — `quote_expired`,
  `quote_already_consumed`, `quote_wallet_mismatch`, `quote_tool_mismatch`,
  `quote_not_found`. Substituting a different number is the one outcome a price
  lock must never produce.
- **Verifiable offline.** The signature covers the wallet, tool, credits, and
  window under the same Ed25519 key as permits and receipts, and is pinned to
  the `active` commitment so spending a quote does not invalidate the proof of
  what was promised.
- Tool pricing moved to `app/services/pricing.py` so the quote endpoint and the
  governed invoke that honors the quote compute from one definition.

### 🙋 Permit requests — an agent can ask a human for authority

- **Added `POST /v1/permit-requests` and `GET /v1/permit-requests/{id}`**
  (`app/routers/permit_requests.py`): an agent states the scope, budget,
  expiry, and justification it needs; a human is paged through Sentinel; the
  middleware mints the signed permit on approval and the agent polls until it
  appears. Backed by the new `permit_requests` table (migration
  `030_permit_requests`). See [`docs/permit-requests.md`](docs/permit-requests.md).
- **The decision binds to the reviewed terms.** Requested scopes, tools,
  budget, and expiry are frozen on the row and hashed; the mint reads that row,
  never the polling request, so an approved request cannot be re-aimed. Reusing
  an `Idempotency-Key` with different terms is a `409`, not a second page.
- **Minting happens exactly once.** The `pending → minting` transition is a
  conditional UPDATE, and the permit id is reserved when the human is paged —
  so a mint retried after a crash adopts the existing permit instead of issuing
  a second one carrying the same authority.
- **Expiry is enforced locally** (Sentinel keeps timed-out approvals "pending"
  forever), and the fail-closed rules match the invoke gate: simulated
  approvals never mint production authority, real mode without Sentinel config
  refuses, and a Sentinel outage returns a retryable `503` having minted
  nothing.
- **Added the approver card** (`app/services/approval_card.py`): scope, budget,
  and justification rendered from one template into both the notification email
  and a hosted page at `GET /v1/permit-requests/{id}/card`, so the two surfaces
  cannot show different terms for one decision. Read-only — approve/reject
  stays in Sentinel.

### 🔌 Standard MCP endpoint (opt-in)

- **Added `POST /mcp`** (`app/routers/mcp_standard.py`): a spec-compliant
  stateless Streamable HTTP surface for standard MCP clients — `initialize`
  with protocol-version negotiation, notifications (202), `ping`,
  `tools/list`, and `tools/call`. JSON responses only; no SSE stream, no
  sessions, so GET/DELETE answer 405. Cross-origin browser calls are
  rejected; batch requests are refused per the 2025-06-18 revision.
- **Server-minted permits keep the trust loop intact.** Standard clients
  cannot supply wallet/permit context, so `tools/call` mints a bounded,
  signed, single-tool, short-lived permit from the caller's wallet
  (`STANDARD_MCP_PERMIT_TTL_SECONDS`, default 120s) and delegates to the
  same governed invoke path as `/mcp/messages` — metering, receipts, and
  audit unchanged. Bootstrap/admin keys are refused (`-32003`): no wallet,
  no call. A client `Idempotency-Key` reuses the same auto-minted permit on
  retry, so governed replay returns the original receipt without a second
  charge.
- **Disabled by default.** `ENABLE_STANDARD_MCP_ENDPOINT=false` returns 404,
  so the surface cannot be advertised — or pass the MCP registry publish
  preflight — before an operator deliberately enables it.

### 📖 Failure semantics as a first-class spec

- **Added [docs/failure-semantics.md](docs/failure-semantics.md).** The
  complete contract for a metered call that dies mid-flight: all seven signed
  terminal outcomes (`success`, `denied`, `insufficient_funds`,
  `failed_refunded`, `delivery_uncertain`, `response_rejected`,
  `failed_unrefunded`), the crash windows the reconciler finalizes (after
  debit, after dispatch, after response, lost commit acks, effect-free), the
  replay contract, exactly-once refunds, and — deliberately — the list of
  things the system does not claim. Every behavioral row names the test that
  asserts it; all 31 cited tests exist and run in CI.
- **Crash-recovered receipts now sign byte-identical permit constraints.**
  The live invoke path normalized `aggregate_value_cap`
  (`Decimal("10.50")` → `"10.5"`) while the reconciler used `str(...)`, so a
  receipt minted during crash recovery could hash a different
  `constraints_evaluated` than a live receipt for the same permit. Both paths
  now delegate to a single `permit_constraints_snapshot` in
  `app/services/permits.py`, with a parity regression test.
- **Closed the one untested terminal outcome.** No test asserted a receipt
  with `outcome="insufficient_funds"`; `tests/test_mcp_trust.py` now proves a
  balance shortfall signs that receipt at 402/`-32004`, executes nothing,
  debits nothing, releases the reserved budget, and replays identically.
- **`delivery_uncertain` is now proved by a real process kill, not only by
  seeded state.** The two-process PostgreSQL harness previously exercised the
  local execution path only: its stress tool was registered with
  `register_local`, its control endpoint never called the dispatch reconciler,
  and so no `mcp_dispatch_attempts` row — and no `delivery_uncertain` — was
  ever produced by an actual crash. The remote state machine's crash behavior
  was covered only by in-process tests that seed durable states through the
  production service API. The harness now also registers an upstream-backed
  tool and gates the two boundaries that matter: `after_mark_dispatched` (past
  the durable checkpoint, before any effect) and `after_upstream_effect` (the
  effect landed, the acknowledgement did not). Killing a worker at either one
  and reconciling proves the attempt terminalizes to `delivery_uncertain`, the
  charge and permit reservation are retained with no refund, the upstream
  side-effect count never grows, a client retry replays the ambiguity instead
  of re-executing, a second sweep is a no-op, and the recovered receipt's full
  evidence bundle verifies.
- The upstream effects table permits duplicate call tokens deliberately, so a
  redispatch after ambiguity would surface as a second row rather than being
  hidden by a unique constraint.
- **Every instrumented crash boundary is now exercised.** The harness
  instruments twelve fault points; six scenarios reached five of them and the
  proof matrix recorded the other seven as a known gap. A table-driven boundary
  suite now kills a worker at each of the seven and pins the disposition it must
  leave, so `prove-crash-recovery` runs thirteen scenarios and the gap is
  closed. Each expectation was checked against the implementing code before
  being asserted, rather than recorded from observed behaviour.
- **Two conservative behaviours were documented more broadly than they are
  implemented, and the docs now say so.** `failure-semantics.md` window E
  claimed an effect-free crash releases the idempotency key for retry; that
  sweep is scoped to `operation_kind == "upstream_mcp"`, so a local-path crash
  in the same window is held in progress and the key cannot be reused without
  an operator. A new window F records the matching budget case: a reservation
  stranded before any charge stays on a live permit — reclaiming it early could
  let a concurrent request over-spend — and is released only when the permit is
  revoked or expires. Both are correct fail-closed choices; neither was
  written down.
- **The pre-checkpoint window is proved by kill too.** A third scenario gates
  `after_debit_commit` on the remote path, killing the worker while the attempt
  is still `prepared` and has not yet been told which ledger entry paid for it.
  Recovery must locate the orphaned debit by its operation identity rather than
  by the attempt's null pointer, refund it exactly once, release the
  reservation, sign `failed_refunded`, and never contact the upstream server.
  This is the counterpart to the ambiguous cases: a crash *before* the
  checkpoint is provably non-delivered, so it resolves in the caller's favour
  rather than being retained.

### 🔍 Observability

- **`/health/dependencies` now reports `environment` and `production_like`.**
  Whether the production trust guardrails engage depends entirely on
  `ENVIRONMENT`, which defaults to `"local"` — but no endpoint exposed the
  resolved value, so the only way to audit a running host was to read its
  secret store. A deploy that never sets the variable runs with those
  guardrails silently disabled; both fields are non-secret and make that
  externally verifiable. Additive: no existing field changed.

### 🔒 Security

- **The child-wallet lifetime spend cap is enforced by the database.**
  `lifetime_debits + charge_amount <= max_spend` was checked against an earlier
  read while the increment happened later, so concurrent charges could push a
  delegated wallet past the ceiling its parent granted. The cap now travels
  with the debit as its own predicate. (Raised by review on #305 — the balance
  guard and the cap are separate predicates, and fixing one did not carry the
  other.)
- **Every wallet money move is now decided by the database too.** The same
  read-modify-write shape as the permit fixes below, in the paths that hold
  actual credits. All were serialized only by `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, a
  silent no-op on SQLite:
  - `charge` read the balance, checked it, and several statements later wrote
    back `balance - amount` computed from that read. A charge committing in
    between was **overwritten**: the ledger recorded the debit but the balance
    never reflected it, so that request was served for free and the books
    stopped balancing. The debit is now one guarded UPDATE that repeats
    `balance >= amount` as its own predicate.
  - `reclaim_child_wallet` read the child's balance, zeroed the child, and
    credited the parent by the amount it had read. Two concurrent reclaims
    each credited the parent in full — **minting credits that never existed**.
    The child's balance is now claimed by a guarded UPDATE before any of it
    reaches the parent.
  - Refund credits (`refund_charge`, and the operator repair in
    `refund_reconciliation`) wrote absolute totals, so one of two concurrent
    refunds was lost outright — the customer's money.
  - The velocity counters `hourly_spent` / `daily_spent` accumulated by
    read-modify-write. Under-counting there does not skew a metric; it is what
    the spend cap and the anomaly auto-freeze are measured against, so **both
    controls silently stopped firing** exactly when spend was most concurrent.
  - The Stripe cumulative-refund clawback wrote a balance derived from an
    earlier read, against fiat Stripe had already returned.
  - `refund_reconciliation` also mutated `permit.spent_credits` directly,
    outside the module that guarantees every such write is guarded. That
    guarantee is only as good as its weakest caller.
  - New `app/db/sql_expressions.py` holds the shared clamped-decrement
    expression, so the safe form is defined once rather than re-derived.
- **Every permit budget write is now decided by the database, not by a value
  this process read earlier.** Three paths in `permits.py` wrote
  `spent_credits` from a stale read, serialized only by `SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE` — which is a silent no-op on SQLite, and nothing in this repository
  forbids SQLite in production. All three are fixed, and each ships a
  regression test confirmed to fail against the unfixed source:
  - `reserve_budget` gated on `status` and the cap but **not on expiry**, so a
    permit past its `expires_at` kept funding work until some other process
    happened to flip its status — authority outliving its own deadline. The
    expiry is now in the statement's predicate.
  - `reserve_budget` also collapsed every guarded-write failure to
    `permit_budget_exceeded`, telling an operator to top up a permit that had
    actually been revoked or had expired. It now classifies status, then
    expiry, then budget, matching `authorize_and_reserve`.
  - `release_dispatch_budget_once` decided whether it had already run by
    reading `budget_released_at` and then writing it. Two callers both saw
    `NULL`, both passed, and the reservation was released **twice**, leaving
    the permit under-spent and able to exceed its own cap. The checkpoint is
    now claimed by a guarded UPDATE before any budget moves.
  - `reconcile_budgets` recomputed an absolute total from receipts and wrote
    it back unconditionally, erasing any reservation that landed mid-pass. It
    now commits only where the stored spend still equals what that pass read,
    and skips rather than clobbering — optimistic concurrency control, with
    the permit re-examined on the next pass.
- **The governed AWI HTTP charge is now keyed to its idempotency record.**
  `awi_http_governance.py` called `money.charge()` with no `operation_key`, so
  the debit had neither the `uq_ledger_wallet_operation_key` constraint nor the
  adopt-the-existing-debit recovery the governed MCP path relies on. If the
  charge committed but its acknowledgement was lost, the handler released the
  permit budget and *completed* the idempotency record as `charge_failed`; the
  caller's key then replayed a permanent error, so a retry under a fresh key
  was **debited a second time for one logical action**, and because
  `response_json` was non-NULL neither reconciler branch ever flagged the
  orphan. Six governed endpoints route through this path. Unlike the
  read-modify-write races elsewhere in this codebase, this one did not depend
  on a row lock being a no-op — it was exposed on PostgreSQL too.
- **The public MCP `verify_receipt` tool no longer describes a caught forgery
  as a verifier limitation.** It reports `MISMATCH` before consulting
  `is_tampered`, so a bundle whose envelope disagrees with its signed content
  is not narrated to the model as a bad signature — or, previously, as
  "CANNOT VERIFY (unsupported)". See `b2a_sdk/CHANGELOG.md` for the verifier
  change this depends on.
- **`.env.production` now sets `ENVIRONMENT=production`.** It omitted the
  variable entirely, so `Settings.ENVIRONMENT` fell back to its `"local"`
  default and `is_production_like_environment()` returned `False` — meaning a
  host deployed from the file named `.env.production` ran with *every*
  production trust guardrail silently disabled.

### 📝 Documentation honesty

An audit of the documented setup paths found 26 confirmed defects. The README
was already accurate; almost everything else was not.

- **Removed `pip install` commands for packages that are not published.**
  `agent-middleware-api`, `agent-middleware-awi`, `langchain-agent-middleware`,
  `crewai-agent-middleware`, and `autogen-agent-middleware` are all absent from
  PyPI, yet were documented as plain installs across the four
  `framework_integrations/README.*` files, the three `wrappers/*/README.md`
  files, `docs/awi-adoption-guide.md`, and two package docstrings. Each now
  documents the local path install that actually works. The wrapper
  instructions install `./b2a_sdk` first, without which the editable install
  fails to resolve its own `b2a-sdk>=0.3.0` dependency.
- **Fixed imports of a module that does not exist.** Every
  `framework_integrations` README documented `from agent_middleware import ...`;
  the importable module is `framework_integrations`.
- **Documented startup blocks now include the signing seed.**
  `docs/golden-path.md`, `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`, and `docs/demo-instance.md` each
  started the API without `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`, so the server exited
  before binding a port and every subsequent step in those guides was
  unreachable. Each now generates the seed once and reuses it, because
  rebinding a `TRUST_SIGNING_KEY_ID` to new material against a persistent
  database is rejected with `signing_key_id_public_key_mismatch`.
- **Corrected SDK constructor keywords.** `docs/agent-recipes.md` and
  `docs/agentmarket-submission.md` passed `api_url=` and `wallet_id=`, both of
  which raise `TypeError`; the parameter is `base_url=` and there is no
  `wallet_id`. All five documented constructors are now verified to construct.
- **Fixed the runnable examples.** `examples/dry_run_example.py` and
  `examples/mcp_tool_example.py` inserted the repository root onto `sys.path`,
  which shadowed the real package (sources live in `b2a_sdk/src`) and made
  every run die at `ImportError: cannot import name 'B2AClient'`.
- **Marked the aspirational parts of `docs/awi-adoption-guide.md`.** `AWIAdapter`
  does not exist anywhere in the tree. AWI sections are now labelled
  `[implemented]` or `[not implemented]`, and the guide leads with the frozen
  proof-surface status. The one adapter that does exist, `AWIFallbackAdapter`,
  now shows its real import path.
- **`examples/dry_run_example.py` now runs to completion.** It created a sponsor
  wallet, then billed every operation against the hardcoded id `sponsor-0`,
  which never exists — the server assigns ids like `spn-bde42b5c4606`. Each
  dry-run call returned `404 wallet_not_found`. The example now uses the id it
  is given, and the `@billable` functions moved inside the demo because the
  decorator captures `wallet_id` at decoration time, before any wallet exists.
  Its docstring now records the real prerequisite: the dry-run endpoints are on
  the billing router, a proof surface, so the API must run with
  `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=true`.
- **`docs/demo-instance.md` no longer points at a missing compose file.**
  `docker-compose.demo.yml` is not in the repository; the guide now says to save
  the inline YAML under that name first.
- **Corrected the `VALID_API_KEYS` comment in `.env.example`.** It promised that
  an empty value yields open/development mode. Open mode also requires
  `DEBUG=true`, and the file ships `DEBUG=false`, so an empty value actually
  fails closed with `403 invalid_api_key`.

### 🐛 Reliability & fixes

- **Added the missing `scripts/core_quality_gate.sh`.**
  `scripts/repo_guardian.py` has always invoked it, but the file did not exist,
  so the guardian's "core quality gate" check failed unconditionally on every
  run and inflated its failure count. It now runs the same `ruff` and `mypy`
  checks as CI's lint job.

### 🐛 Onboarding & developer experience

- **`.env.example` now produces a server that boots.** `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED`
  defaults to true and trust mode refuses to start without signing material, so
  `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` is required in *every* environment — but it
  was documented only inside a commented-out block labelled "production
  checklist". Copying the file and starting the API died with
  `SigningKeyError: trust_signing_private_key_required`. The signing seed is now
  a required top-level key with the generation command inline. The durable-state
  defaults also moved from a placeholder PostgreSQL DSN (which failed with
  `socket.gaierror` under `ENVIRONMENT=local`) to the local SQLite path the
  README documents, with the PostgreSQL block kept as commented production
  guidance.
- **Failed startups now say how to fix themselves.** Signing-key validation
  failures log an actionable `remediation` field — including the exact seed
  generation command — next to the existing error code. The
  `trust_signing_private_key_required` /
  `invalid_trust_signing_private_key` codes are unchanged, so
  `/health/dependencies` consumers are unaffected.
- **Trust gate scripts no longer depend on a specific interpreter name.**
  `scripts/trust_coverage_gate.sh` and `scripts/trust_release_gate.sh` resolved
  `python3.12` by existence alone and fell back only to `python`, skipping
  `python3`. On any machine where a bare `python3.12` is on `PATH` without the
  project's dependencies, both gates failed with `No module named pytest`. They
  now share `scripts/lib/python_env.sh`, which selects the first interpreter
  that can actually import pytest and otherwise falls back to
  `uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt`, matching every other Makefile
  target. `PYTHON` and `PYTEST` overrides still work, and CI behaviour is
  unchanged.

## 1.2.0 deployment (untagged) - 2026-08-08

The Railway deployment reported application version `1.2.0`, but no final
`v1.2.0` tag was created. `f365b69` was part of the deployment history, not a
final release tag. These are the accumulated changes since v1.1.0; they will be
released together with subsequent public-product work as `v1.3.0` after the
exact release commit passes the full gate.

### 🔒 Security

- Removed a leaked production API key, added secret scanning, and hardened the
  live test harness (#201).
- API key rotation: runbook, generator/verifier tooling, and incident record
  (#202).
- Closed confirmed trust-plane authorization and isolation gaps (#203).
- Key revocation now contains compromises; negative-balance chargebacks are
  contained (#204).
- Removed plaintext owner keys and made owner-key retirement rolling-safe
  (#205); closed the refresh-token rollout window.
- **CORS: never pair credentialed responses with a wildcard origin** (#206).
  With `CORS_ORIGINS="*"` (the default) and `allow_credentials=True`, Starlette
  reflected the caller's `Origin` and still returned
  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, allowing any website to make
  credentialed cross-origin reads against the trust plane. Credentials are now
  enabled only when `CORS_ORIGINS` is an explicit allowlist; a wildcard origin
  serves `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with credentials disabled. Operators
  running a browser client on a separate origin must set `CORS_ORIGINS` to that
  origin's exact value. Added regression tests in `tests/test_cors_security.py`.

### 🛡️ Trust plane & governance

- Hardened governed MCP dispatch and the SDK; closed MCP transport and refund
  gaps.
- Trust-plane P0 integrity hardening; permit creation captures `subject_key_id`
  from the auth context.
- **Key rotation now revokes the old authority** (#207). Rotation previously
  left the superseded authority usable, so a rotation performed in response to a
  compromise did not actually contain it.
- **Frozen-wallet denial semantics preserved** (#208), keeping the distinct
  frozen error code rather than collapsing it into a generic denial.
- **Child-wallet TTL enforced across every governed spend path** (#209), with
  follow-up review gaps closed (#213).

### ✨ Features

- Human dashboard, observability endpoints, and accessibility tests.
- Budget percentage alerts and `/v1/me/alerts`.
- Opt-in `ENABLE_DOGFOOD_TOOL` for live `partner.notes.write`.
- Agent-discovery pointers on the marketing site, plus published agent discovery
  entrypoints (#210).

### 🌐 Site

- Canonicalized the legacy Vercel host (#211) and redirected the legacy Vercel
  root (#212).

### 🐛 Reliability & fixes

- Validate the signing key at startup and in health checks.
- Normalize tz-aware datetimes to naive UTC for PostgreSQL; keep migration
  revisions PostgreSQL-compatible.
- Fix sponsor-wallet ledger FK ordering; harden production migration boot.
- Discovery honesty: stop advertising unpublished SDK installs; gate MCP
  discovery behind the wedge.

### 📦 Dependencies

- Bumped `mcp`, `stripe`, `uvicorn`, and `redis` (Dependabot).
