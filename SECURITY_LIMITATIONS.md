# Security Limitations

This repository is not yet compliance-grade autonomous economic actor
infrastructure.

## Current Trust Boundary

The implemented trust boundary is governed MCP tool invocation. Other modules
are proof surfaces unless they consume the same permit, receipt, idempotency,
and audit-chain primitives.

The remote pilot supports one operator-configured HTTPS Streamable HTTP MCP
origin and one exact tool. Wallet checks provide application-layer isolation;
there is no row-level-security or public multi-tenant security claim.

The supported design-partner deployment is one vendor-managed Railway project
per customer, with dedicated API, PostgreSQL, Redis, domain, signing material,
and administrator credentials. It is restricted to synthetic or redacted,
low-sensitivity data: PHI, PCI data, regulated production records, and
sensitive tool arguments are out of scope. Shared SaaS, customer-VPC/BYOC, and
customer-operated on-premises deployments are not supported in this pilot.

High-risk AWI HTTP routes (`/v1/awi/execute`, passkey, rag index/query,
`dom/sync`) also require `X-Permit-Id` + `Idempotency-Key`; successful metered
calls emit receipts. Their current abort paths do not have the durable
dispatch/charge linkage needed to mint trustworthy denial receipts, so use the
MCP gateway for portable denial evidence.

## Not Yet Solved (Deferred By Design)

Keep these out of the wedge until a design partner requires them:

- No external KMS integration is implemented.
- No settlement, dispute, or compliance reporting workflow is implemented.
- Receipt signatures can be verified offline by any third party
  (`/v1/receipts/{id}/portable` plus the unauthenticated
  `/.well-known/trust-keys.json`), but no external transparency log exists. A
  receipt proves what happened, never what did not: absence of a receipt is
  not evidence that no action occurred.
- Offline verification trusts the issuing origin for key distribution. Keys
  arrive over TLS from the same origin being audited, so a compromised origin
  can serve a key set that validates forged receipts. Out-of-band key pinning
  is not implemented.
- Wrap-and-anchor evidence is not implemented. The intended later
  composition is anchoring/publication: wrap today's receipt claims as an
  in-toto/DSSE predicate and submit the statement hash to Rekor or a
  SCITT log. That does not provision independently trusted issuer keys.
  Signing the wrap under a Sigstore or SPIFFE gateway identity still
  authenticates the inner claims with this origin unless the slice names
  a trust root that is not this origin (Fulcio/TUF, pinned SPIFFE, or
  an out-of-band pin) and verification uses that root. Unfreeze for
  anchoring when a named partner needs an independently timestamped
  receipt hash. Unfreeze for key distribution only when that partner
  cannot trust this origin for keys and that independently trusted key
  source is named. This freeze does not specify `receipt_id` as a log
  subject, conflict detection, or trusted-checkpoint consistency/witness
  evidence, so it does not claim non-equivocation. A log still does not
  prove an action did not occur, and it does not replace the ledger. See
  [`WEDGE.md`](WEDGE.md) § What To Freeze.
- Audit chains are wallet-scoped, but database administrators can still delete
  rows unless append-only storage or external anchoring is added.
- Multi-protocol governed adapters beyond MCP are not implemented (MCP only).
- A timeout or disconnect after the durable dispatch checkpoint is inherently
  ambiguous. The gateway retains the debit, signs `delivery_uncertain`, never
  redispatches automatically, and requires operator/upstream reconciliation.
- Gateway exactly-once behavior does not make a remote side effect exactly
  once unless the upstream honors the forwarded idempotency key.
- The configured upstream path atomically enforces the permit's `max_credits`
  ceiling. It rejects permits carrying `max_calls_per_tool` or
  `aggregate_value_cap` before reservation or dispatch because it does not yet
  implement an atomic remote counter-and-release lifecycle for those fields.
  On the local path, `aggregate_value_cap` is a predicate of the same
  guarded reservation `UPDATE` as `max_credits`, against `spent_credits`
  (settled charges plus in-flight reservations) floored to the permit's
  receipt total. The configured upstream path still rejects it before
  reservation or dispatch.
- URL validation rejects unsafe destinations and redirects, then pins one
  validated resolved address through the later connection while preserving the
  configured HTTP Host and TLS SNI. Production should still enforce a network
  egress allowlist/proxy for the single partner origin as defense in depth.
- The upstream limit is enforced on the streamed identity-encoded HTTP body,
  including the JSON-RPC envelope, before buffering and parsing. Retained
  decoded discovery and result payloads are bounded again after validation.
- Inbound request bodies are bounded on every route by
  `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` (1 MiB default), refused with a 413 before the rate
  limiter or any handler buffers them. An oversized declared `Content-Length`
  is rejected without reading the body; an understated one is caught by
  measuring the stream. The opt-in MCP transports keep their own tighter caps
  (256 KiB public, 64 KiB partner). This bounds per-request memory, not
  aggregate concurrency — a request-count/connection limit at the edge is
  still the operator's job.
- No public uptime SLA, compliance scope, RTO/RPO, tenant-isolation guarantee,
  or immutable-ledger claim is made.
- Sandbox and AWI/browser automation are not production isolation boundaries.
- Auto-PR and agentic workflow automation must treat GitHub issues, PRs,
  comments, webhook bodies, tool outputs, and generated scripts as untrusted.

## Required Production Posture

Operator deploy path and variable checklist:
[`docs/deploy-railway.md`](docs/deploy-railway.md) (`railway up` from this
repo; do not Redeploy from GitHub source).

- `TRUST_MODE_ENABLED=true` and `ALLOW_LEGACY_UNPERMITTED_MCP=false` are the
  shipped defaults. A production-like environment cannot boot under any
  permissive combination — `app.core.trust_mode.validate_trust_mode_guardrails`
  refuses to start. Local/dev/test deployments that need legacy behavior must
  set both env vars explicitly; the startup log emits a `trust_mode_permissive`
  warning so the opt-out is loud.
- Configure `TRUST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` from a secret manager or KMS-backed
  runtime injection.
- Production-like boots also refuse `DEBUG=true`, `WEBAUTHN_ALLOW_MOCK=true`,
  and `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=true`. Set `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=false` so only
  core trust routers and MCP are mounted. Leave proof surfaces frozen unless a
  partner demo explicitly needs them.
- Set `PUBLIC_URL` to the public HTTPS API origin (Railway host or custom
  domain). Agents and `/llm.txt` use it; do not leave production pointing at
  localhost.
- Set `VALID_API_KEYS` only via host secrets / Railway service variables. The
  API-only [`.railway/railway.ts`](.railway/railway.ts) graph preserves the key
  name without owning or exposing its value; every configured API key uses
  `preserve()`. Never commit real keys or use the placeholder `change-me` in
  production.
- Disable or isolate proof surfaces that execute code, drive browsers, generate
  patches, crawl external URLs, or touch third-party systems.
- When `REDIS_URL` is set, production-like environments fail closed on Redis
  rate-limiter outage (HTTP 503) instead of silently using per-process memory.
  `/health/dependencies` exposes `runtime_degradation` when any configured
  backend has fallen back to in-memory.
- All Phase 9 AWI MCP tools always require signed permits (`requirePermit` in
  `/mcp/tools.json`), even if legacy unpermitted MCP is enabled. Those stubs
  are not wedge product; Phase 2 drops them from discovery when proof
  surfaces are off — see partner inventory note in
  [`DESIGN_PARTNER_GUIDE.md`](DESIGN_PARTNER_GUIDE.md#mcp-discovery-gate-phase-2).
- Run migrations (`alembic upgrade head` or `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START=true` on
  the Docker entrypoint) instead of relying on
  `SQLModel.metadata.create_all`. Production-like boots skip `create_all`,
  verify required trust tables, and fail closed if the schema is missing.
  `create_all` remains only for ephemeral non-production SQLite (tests/local).
- Keep CI trust invariant tests required before merge. CI also runs a
  `production_trust` subset with production-like trust flags.

## CORS Posture

The default `CORS_ORIGINS=*` is a deliberate decision, not an oversight:

- Every authenticated route takes explicit header credentials (`X-API-Key`
  or `Authorization: Bearer`), never cookies or other ambient browser
  credentials, so there is nothing a cross-origin page can ride.
- `app.main.add_cors_middleware` refuses to pair a wildcard with
  credentialed CORS: under `*`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is never
  emitted. An explicit origin list is required before credentialed
  cross-origin requests are possible at all.
- What the wildcard actually grants is cross-origin *reads of public
  discovery surfaces* (`/.well-known/*`, `/health*`, `/llms.txt`,
  `/openapi.json`) — the same material any non-browser client already gets —
  which is standard posture for a public, header-authenticated API.
- The one route that is unauthenticated yet returns a secret
  (`/v1/dev-keys/self-provision`, local-only) independently rejects
  cross-origin browser calls by `Origin` check, and production-like
  environments refuse to boot with it enabled.

Operators who put a credentialed browser app in front of this API must set
`CORS_ORIGINS` to an explicit comma-separated origin list. Startup logs
`cors_wildcard_active` whenever the wildcard posture is in effect.

## Rate Limit Posture

The application-layer limiter is present on auth-gated routes. A burst of
a few dozen requests drawing zero `429`s is the intended threshold, not a
missing control.

- Default and production value: `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=120`, 60-second window,
  no burst allowance. The 121st counted request in that window is the first
  that returns `429` with `Retry-After`.
- **Window accounting differs by backend, so the published contract states the
  budget and the window length, not an algorithm.** The shared Redis limiter
  counts fixed 60-second buckets, so a caller straddling a bucket boundary can
  land up to twice the budget inside one arbitrary 60-second span. The
  in-memory fallback counts a rolling 60 seconds and is strictly tighter; it is
  never reached in a production-like environment, which fails closed instead.
  `rate_limits.window_accounting` in discovery names this difference.
- **Authenticated:** one bucket per `X-API-Key` value.
- **No key:** one shared `anonymous` bucket for the whole deployment.
- **Rejected credentials:** the per-key bucket is selected from a
  caller-supplied header before the key has been verified, so every request
  whose credentials the app refuses is additionally charged to one shared
  per-client bucket at ten times the per-key limit. Rotating a fresh invalid
  `X-API-Key` per request therefore buys no extra budget; the client is bounded
  by that bucket no matter how many key values it invents.
  - **Refused means `401` *or* `403`.** An unknown but well-formed key — what
    a rotating caller actually sends — is answered `403 invalid_api_key`, not
    `401`, so counting only `401`s would miss the vector entirely.
  - **A denial is not a refusal.** An authenticated caller denied on scope
    (`wallet_access_denied`, `insufficient_scope`, an IGA decision) is
    ordinary governed-loop traffic and is never charged here. The two are told
    apart by an internal marker the auth layer sets, stripped before the
    response leaves the innermost middleware.
  - **The budget is reserved before the request runs**, and handed back unless
    the credentials were refused. Reading the bucket and charging it after the
    response would let every request already in flight pass the same read, so
    the ceiling would only bound callers who arrive one request at a time.
  - A request whose credentials the app accepts leaves the bucket exactly as
    it found it. Client identity is the ingress peer address (Railway's
    `X-Real-IP` only where the platform marker is present, per the public-MCP
    rule above), so callers sharing one egress address share that bucket — and
    callers spread across many source addresses get one such bucket each. A
    distributed flood is still the edge's job.
- **Counted responses** — including `401`s — carry `X-RateLimit-Limit`,
  `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset`. Remaining dropping from
  119 toward 80 with no `429` means the budget has not been reached.
- **Exempt paths** (no count, no `429`): `/`, `/health`, `/docs`, `/redoc`,
  `/openapi.json`, `/.well-known/agent.json`, `/llms.txt`, and the served
  markdown docs. `/health/dependencies` is counted.
- This is a request-count ceiling, not a connection or bandwidth limit. An
  edge request-count/connection cap remains the operator's job, as noted
  under inbound body bounding above.
- Redis outage in production-like environments fails closed (`503`), never
  silently wider than declared.

`GET /` and `GET /v1/discover` both publish this as `rate_limits`.

## Response Hardening Headers

Every response gets `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options:
SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and a
`Content-Security-Policy`. JSON is `default-src 'none'`. First-party HTML
(dashboard, approval cards) allows inline CSS and no scripts. `/docs` and
`/redoc` additionally allow jsDelivr plus an inline boot script, a `blob:` Web
Worker, and Google Fonts, because that is how FastAPI's stock Swagger UI /
ReDoc load. HSTS (`max-age=63072000;
includeSubDomains`, no `preload`) is emitted only on requests that arrived
over TLS. Tenant-sensitive paths (`/v1/*` except `/v1/discover`, `/mcp`
except the public tools manifest) send `Cache-Control: no-store`. Public
discovery is left cacheable so agents can keep OpenAPI and well-known
documents.

## One Auth Story, One Invoke Story (Dormant Surfaces)

The wedge contract is **send the API key** (`X-API-Key`). Surfaces that told
a second story are unmounted in production and absent from the public
OpenAPI contract (they mount only with `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=true`, which
production-like boots refuse):

- `/v1/auth/token|refresh|revoke` (JWT exchange) — `app.core.auth` still
  *validates* Bearer JWTs, but nothing can mint one while the router is
  unmounted, so the key header is the only production auth path.
- `/v1/kyc/*` (Stripe Identity), `/v1/planner/optimize`, and the billing
  expansion surfaces (child/swarm wallets, transfers, top-ups, marketplace,
  velocity status, dry-run sandbox) — real code, dormant demand; see
  `DORMANT_TRUST_ROUTERS` in `app/main.py`.
- `/v1/webhooks/stripe*` mount only when Stripe is actually configured.
- `/v1/dev-keys/self-provision` stays runtime-gated by its own flag and is
  advertised in the schema only when that flag is on (never in production).

The legacy invoke entry points `POST /mcp/messages` and
`POST /mcp/tools/{id}/invoke` remain mounted for existing clients and the
local proof scripts but are marked `deprecated` in the spec; the standard
MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint at `POST /mcp` is the supported path. All entry
points run the same governed permit→meter→receipt path.

## Public Health Reporting

With proof surfaces unmounted, the unauthenticated `/health/dependencies`
payload reports only what the wedge runs on (postgres, redis, signing key,
upstream MCP, version + commit SHA, environment posture). Per-service
simulation flags and proof-surface dependency probes are not published
there; they appear in the startup log (`phase="runtime_posture"`) and on
instances that mount proof surfaces, where they describe live routes.
