"""Record the governed-loop transcript the public site renders.

The landing page shows the governed loop as a terminal transcript: real
requests, real responses, and the offline verifier's real output. Nothing on
that page is typed in by hand — every line comes from ``site/proof/transcript.json``,
and this script is the only thing that writes that file.

It runs ``scripts/demo_trust_plane.py`` (the same proof ``make prove-trust-plane``
runs) against a throwaway local SQLite gateway with the demo signing key,
records every HTTP exchange the demo makes through its helpers, and keeps
the ones the page shows, in loop order rather than run order (the demo checks
the audit chain and denies the out-of-scope call in a different sequence than
the loop the page narrates; every line is still a real exchange). The demo's
timed run of fresh governed calls is deliberately not recorded exchange by
exchange: the demo times raw requests with nothing in between, and only its
summary (sample count, p50, p95) lands in the transcript. It then runs the
SDK's offline verifier twice: once on the portable receipt the demo produced,
and once on the live receipt published at ``site/proof/receipt.json`` — that
second output is what the proof section prints, so it has to come from the
real CLI too.

    python scripts/record_site_transcript.py          # rewrite the transcript
    python scripts/record_site_transcript.py --check  # fail if it is stale

``--check`` re-records and compares everything except the fields that change
on every run (ids, timestamps, hashes, signatures), so CI can tell "someone
edited the JSON by hand" from "the demo ran again".

Secrets never reach the file: the operator key and the minted agent key are
replaced with placeholders before anything is written.
