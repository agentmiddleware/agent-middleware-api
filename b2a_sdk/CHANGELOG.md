# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.5.0

`pyproject.toml` carries `0.5.0` from here on. `0.4.0` is published and
tagged `python-sdk-v0.4.0`, and the entries below are new surface area on
top of it, so leaving the source at `0.4.0` would have shipped something
materially different under a version already in the wild. A minor bump:
everything here is additive, with one bounded exception: `settle_402()` now
prefers `amount_usd` over the legacy `amount` alias when a requirement carries
both with different values (see below). `parse_402_response()` always sets the
two equal, so the normal path is unchanged. The tag is not cut by this
change — `python-sdk-v0.5.0` is still a release decision.

### Audit follow-up (2026-10-01)

Security and correctness fixes from the 2026-08-27 repository audit. The only
incompatible change is `B2AEdgeClient.execute_awi_action()`, and 0.5.0 is
still unreleased.

- **Replay-safe legacy charges**: `AgentMiddlewareClient.charge()` takes a
  keyword-only `idempotency_key`, validated before anything is sent and
  forwarded as `Idempotency-Key`; a 409 on a keyed charge raises
  `IdempotencyConflictError`. `@billable` and `@combined` take an
  `idempotency_key_factory`, called with the decorated function's arguments,
  so retries of one logical call derive the same key. Calls without a key are
  unchanged and are not replay-safe.
- **`create_agent_wallet(daily_limit=0)`** now sends the zero cap ("spend
  nothing"). A truthiness test used to drop it, which the server reads as
  "no cap".
- **`@monitored`** no longer sends the exception text or a stack trace to
  telemetry by default; pass `capture_traceback=True` to include them. Its
  sync wrapper no longer raises `RuntimeError` when called with no running
  event loop: the telemetry event is dropped and the wrapped function's own
  result or exception comes back.
- **`api_key` is a read-only property** on `AgentMiddlewareClient` and
  `X402Client`, read from the transport's `X-API-Key` header, so `vars()`
  dumps no longer contain the key. Assigning to it raises `AttributeError`;
  assignment never changed the key actually sent.
- **`B2AEdgeClient.execute_awi_action()`** requires keyword `permit_id` and
  `idempotency_key` and sends them as `X-Permit-Id` and `Idempotency-Key`.
  The server already required both, so the old call always failed with 403
  or 400. Blank values raise `ValueError` before any request is sent.

### Added

- **ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) checkout**: Add `ACPLineItem`,
  `ACPCheckoutRequest`, `ACPCheckoutResponse` models and
  `AgentMiddlewareClient.acp_checkout()` method for POST /v1/billing/acp/checkout.
  The server mints the permit; this is not invoke_tool. Proof-only: the
  endpoint is on the server's dormant `billing.expansion_router` and is
  mounted only when `ENABLE_PROOF_SURFACES=true`, so deployments with proof
  surfaces off return 404. `ACPLineItem.sku` defaults to `None`, so a line
  item without a SKU is built by omitting it. `sponsor_wallet_id` and
  `agent_wallet_id` are required and sent as query params, matching the server
  route. `ACPCheckoutRequest.spt_token` is declared `repr=False`, so the
  delegated payment credential does not surface in logs or tracebacks that
  render the request object. It is still sent on the wire by `to_payload()`,
  which callers must not log.
- **IGA bearer authentication**: `AgentMiddlewareClient.__init__()` accepts an
  optional `bearer_token` parameter. When set, the client sends
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` alongside X-API-Key for IGA-governed flows
  (the governed invoke endpoint reads the bearer when `IGA_TRUSTED_ISSUERS` is
  set). The client never mints tokens itself.
- **x402 parse endpoint**: Add `X402Client.parse_402()` method for POST
  /v1/x402/parse. It returns a validated requirement dict — not a typed model —
  with `amount_usd`, `pay_to` and `network` required and `asset` optional; a 2xx
  body missing a required field raises `APIError` rather than reaching
  settlement. The client-side `parse_402_response()`
  helper now returns `amount_usd` to match, alongside the legacy `amount`
  key (same value) so existing callers keep working. `settle_402()` reads
  `amount_usd` first and falls back to `amount` only when it is absent, so the
  canonical field decides the settled amount.
- **In-process permit validation**: Document `LocalPermitValidator` and
  `GovernedEdgeSession` in README. These classes, already shipped in 0.5.0,
  verify a permit's Ed25519 signature locally and mirror the server's per-call
  permit checks in-process (expiry, tool scope, per-tool call caps, and budget
  when `estimated_credits` is supplied) with no server round trip for
  locally-denied calls. Local signature verification needs the optional
  `verify` extra (`pip install './b2a_sdk[verify]'`); without it,
  `GovernedEdgeSession.open()` raises
  `PermitDeniedError("permit_verification_unavailable")`.
- **`mcp` extra**: `pip install './b2a_sdk[mcp]'` installs the MCP SDK for
  `python -m b2a_sdk.mcp serve` and the generated standalone server, bounded
  to `>=1.29.0,<2` to match the application. mcp 2.x renamed `FastMCP` to
  `MCPServer`, which both paths import. The import-error hints now name the
  bound (or the extra) instead of an unbounded `pip install mcp`.

### Fixed

- **charge() HTTP 402**: A payment-required body whose `detail` is not an
  object, whose JSON cannot be read, or whose `shortfall` is not a finite
  number now raises `InsufficientFundsError` with that body attached, instead
  of `AttributeError`, `ValueError`, or `JSONDecodeError`. A server
  `top_up_url` is kept. A path that starts with `/` is joined to the client
  base URL. The dashboard URL is used only when the server omits one. HTTP 403
  is unchanged and still raises `httpx.HTTPStatusError`.
- **x402 settle errors**: `permit_write_contended` (HTTP 503) stays `APIError`
  with status 503, so a caller can retry that same idempotency key. Other
  `permit_*` denials stay `PermitDeniedError` and keep the real status (400
  or 404) instead of a hardcoded 403. A body whose error is
  `insufficient_funds` raises `InsufficientFundsError`. Any other HTTP 402,
  including `x402_invalid_requirement`, stays `APIError`.
- **Idempotency-Key**: the SDK, the edge client, and the legacy framework
  client reject C0 and DEL characters before sending. The framework client
  now strips surrounding whitespace and enforces 128 characters on the
  stripped key, matching the SDK, so a padded key is not a second charge.
  A key already stored with its padding will not match a later stripped retry.

- **x402 HTTP 402 handling**: The x402 module's `parse_402()` and `settle_402()`
  methods do not collapse an HTTP 402 status into `InsufficientFundsError`. A
  402 response with valid x402 headers is parsed as a payment requirement, not
  a billing error. `InsufficientFundsError` is raised only when the response
  body signals `insufficient_funds`.

### Deprecations

- **Deprecated `B2AEdgeClient.call_mcp_tool()`**: This method bypasses the
  trust-plane loop (no permit, no idempotency key, no signed receipt, no replay
  protection). Each call dispatches and charges independently, making retry a
  double-charge. Use `AgentMiddlewareClient.invoke_tool()` instead, which
  requires a permit and idempotency key for governed invocations with replay
  protection and signed receipts.
- Updated framework wrapper READMEs (langchain, crewai, autogen) to document
  that direct tool calls bypass the trust plane and lack replay protection.

- Add `b2a_sdk.receipt_verifier` for offline verification of portable trust
  receipts. It imports nothing from the middleware application and needs no
  network access: given a bundle and a published key set, it checks the
  Ed25519 signature over the exact signed bytes and reports only fields read
  from inside them.
- Distinguish a failed verification (`INVALID`) from an undetermined one
  (`UNKNOWN_KEY`, `MALFORMED`, `UNSUPPORTED`), so callers do not mistake a
  stale key cache for tampering. A bundle that is internally inconsistent —
  or that disagrees with a caller-supplied `expected_issuer` — is `MISMATCH`:
  a finding about the bundle, distinct from both families.
- Read `kid`, `alg`, and `canonicalization` from the **signed** payload, never
  from the surrounding envelope. The envelope is unauthenticated, so letting it
  select the key or gate the capability checks would let one edited byte
  downgrade a genuine receipt to `UNSUPPORTED` — an attacker-chosen "your
  verifier is too old" that reads as a verifier problem rather than a bundle
  problem. Envelope values are cross-checked *after* the signature verifies,
  and any disagreement is reported as `MISMATCH`.
- Add `VerificationResult.is_rejected`, true for `INVALID` and `MISMATCH` —
  the property callers should branch on for "do not trust this bundle".
  `is_tampered` stays narrow (`INVALID` only), because `MISMATCH` also covers
  an `expected_issuer` disagreement, which is not a claim about tampering.
- Add the `b2a-verify-receipt` CLI, with exit codes `0` verified, `1` rejected
  (`INVALID` or `MISMATCH`), `2` undetermined.
- Add the `verify` extra (`pip install "b2a-sdk[verify]"`) for the
  `cryptography` dependency. The base install is unchanged; importing
  `b2a_sdk` without the extra still works, and only signature checking
  requires it.
- Require `cryptography>=50.0.0` in the `verify` and `dev` extras, matching
  the application's own floor: every 42.x–49.x release carries at least one
  published advisory, and a receipt *verifier* must not itself depend on a
  known-vulnerable cryptography build.

## 0.4.0

- Add the typed async `AgentMiddlewareClient` trust-loop API.
- Require caller-provided idempotency keys for permit creation and tool calls.
- Expose typed permits, receipts, verification results, and evidence bundles.
- Raise typed authentication, authorization, permit, billing, idempotency,
  delivery-uncertainty, API, and transport errors.
- Retain `B2AClient` as a deprecated compatibility name.
- Build installable wheel and source artifacts from the standard `src/` layout.
