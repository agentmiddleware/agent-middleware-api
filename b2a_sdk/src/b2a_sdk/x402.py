"""x402 facilitation helpers for the middleware settle endpoint.

Client-side only: detect an HTTP 402 payment demand on a response, extract
its ``X-402-*`` headers, and ask the trust plane to authorize and settle it
against a permit. The dict ``settle_402`` returns carries the
transfer-authorization payload the *payer wallet* must sign — this SDK holds
no on-chain keys and signs nothing itself; the middleware's role is
facilitation (permit budget authorization, shadow-ledger metering, signed
receipt), never on-chain settlement.
