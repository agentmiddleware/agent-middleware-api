"""What a contended receipt insert is allowed to tell the caller.

The receipt is the last write on the governed money path, and it was the only
one without a write-conflict restart: the wallet debit, the permit reserve, the
idempotency record and the dispatch attempt all wrap theirs in
``run_with_write_conflict_retry``. So once those stopped losing SQLite locks,
the surviving contention landed on ``INSERT INTO receipts`` and escaped as an
unclassified JSON-RPC ``internal_error``.

That is the specific thing this file exists to prevent, and the reason it
matters is the one written on ``LedgerWriteContendedError``: a client that
cannot tell an unclassified failure from a named retryable one has to assume
its money may have moved. The case actually observed in CI was a *denial* --
``outcome='denied'``, ``reason_code='permit_budget_exceeded'``,
``credits_charged=0`` -- where nothing had been charged and the true answer was
sitting in the row that failed to insert.

The classification splits the same way the audit chain's does, and for the same
reason (see ``tests/test_audit_chain_contention_surface.py``):

- a refusal that ran nothing may say "retry", because a second attempt costs
  nothing and no terminal record was left behind;
- a call that already ran and was charged may not, because "retry" would invite
  a second execution of something the caller has paid for.

Contention is injected at the receipt service's own session factory rather than
raced. A test that waits for a real lock passes on a fast machine for the wrong
reason -- which is exactly how the original defect survived roughly three weeks
of being called flaky.

    never added to. Its ladder ends in ``except Exception`` returning
    ``_internal_error_tool_result`` -- a 200 carrying ``isError`` and an opaque
