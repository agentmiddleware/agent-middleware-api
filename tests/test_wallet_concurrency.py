"""Lost-update proofs for the wallet provisioning and transfer debits.

#305 converted the charge debit, the child reclaim, refunds, and the velocity
counters to guarded updates. It left three: the sponsor provisioning debit,
the parent delegation debit, and the transfer debit, all still reading a
balance, deciding, and writing the decided value back. They rely on
``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` to keep a second writer out of that window, and
SQLAlchemy **silently drops** ``FOR UPDATE`` on SQLite, so on that engine the
window is wide open.

Ordinary concurrency does not reproduce it: SQLite serializes the write
transactions, so two ``asyncio.gather``-ed operations simply take turns and
the second one reads fresh data. What the dropped lock actually allows is
narrower -- a competing writer committing *between* one operation's read and
its write -- so these tests inject exactly that, by wrapping a call the
operation already awaits inside that window and committing the competing
write from it. Nothing about the assertion depends on the injection: the
operation is left to decide on its own, and a decision made from the value it
read rather than the value the row holds is what fails.

They run on SQLite, because that is where the defect is reachable: the
injection only works while the row lock is a no-op. Pointed at PostgreSQL the
injected writer would block on the lock the operation under test genuinely
holds, so they skip there. The PostgreSQL side of the same guarantee is
covered by real concurrent operations in
``tests/test_permit_postgres_concurrency.py``, and the paths #305 already
fixed are covered by ``tests/test_wallet_ledger_integrity.py``.
