"""Where an audit-chain loss is retryable, and the one place it must not be.

``append_chained_audit_event`` retries a contended per-wallet chain head 64
times and then raises ``AuditChainContendedError``. What that should mean to
the caller depends entirely on whether the call had already run.

A refusal that ran nothing -- a permit denial, a lost quote -- can say "retry":
no tool executed and no wallet moved, so a second attempt costs nothing and the
first left no terminal record behind. That is the retryable ``-32005`` answer.

Every audit write past the charge is the opposite, and is the reason this file
exists. It audits *after* the tool ran and the wallet was charged, so "retry"
would invite a second execution of a call the caller already paid for. Nor can
it be softened into a success: ``create_receipt`` takes
``audit_event_id=audit_event.event_id``, so no audit event means no signed
receipt either, and ``reconcile_stuck_records`` repairs a stuck record only when
a receipt exists -- without one it counts the record for manual review instead.
The honest answer there is its own non-retryable code, ``-32007``: the state is
one the pipeline classified deliberately, so spending the unclassified
``-32603`` on it hid a known outcome among genuine bugs and left a client free
to read "internal error" as "try again".

Finalization is only the most obvious of those sites. The local
refund-succeeded path and the upstream post-charge helpers audit after
execution too, and guarding finalize alone left both free to hand a caller who
had already run and paid a "retry" -- so each is pinned separately below rather
than trusted to a shared reading of the control flow.

The retryable half carries its own obligation, tested here too: the -32005 has
to name a retry the caller can actually make. A governed call has an
idempotency record open by the time these refusals happen, and reconciliation
deliberately does not delete uncharged local records, so a record left in
progress would meet every retry of that key with ``idempotency_in_progress``
forever.
