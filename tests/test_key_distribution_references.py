"""Guard against key-distribution reference drift.

The Hard Run Report (P1-B) found surfaces that pointed agents and humans at
``/.well-known/jwks.json`` for offline verification while that path returned
404. P1-B is resolved two ways: the surfaces below now name
``/.well-known/trust-keys.json``, and ``/.well-known/jwks.json`` is served as a
standard RFC 7517 JWK Set view of the same keys (``get_jwks_json`` in
``app/routers/well_known.py``; its contract is pinned by
``tests/test_receipt_portability.py::test_jwks_endpoint_needs_no_credential``).

``trust-keys.json`` stays the canonical anchor these surfaces must name: it
carries each key's status and its issuance/retirement timestamps, which a bare
JWK Set omits (``_published_key`` in the same router). Mentioning
``jwks.json`` alongside it is fine; dropping the canonical anchor is not.

This test pins the trust-plane surfaces that tell an outside party where to
fetch the signing keys. It intentionally does NOT scan the whole tree: the Hard
Run Report itself quotes the old 404 as its finding, which is correct.
