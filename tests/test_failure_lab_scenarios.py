"""Contract guards for the failure-lab scenario suite.

The expensive part of the suite runs in its own CI job
(``python -m failure_lab run --tier fast``). What belongs here is the set of
properties a contributor must not be able to break without noticing:

* every scenario declares a claim, a tier, and a documented expectation for
  every configuration it runs;
* the expectation map is the guarantee the product *documents*, so a scenario
  whose observed verdict drifts away from it fails loudly rather than quietly
  being re-baselined;
* no scenario can report PASS without having implemented anything.

One scenario is executed end to end in strict trust mode, so the suite cannot
rot into a set of well-formed classes that no longer run.
