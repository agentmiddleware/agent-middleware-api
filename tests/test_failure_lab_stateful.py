"""The state-machine explorer's invariants must be real and must be checkable.

A property-based harness earns its keep in two ways: the invariants describe
properties of the *observations* rather than restating what the code does, and
a violation produces a reproduction someone can act on. Both are pinned here.

The exploration itself is deliberately small — the point is that the machinery
works and is seeded reproducibly, not to search hard. The searching happens in
the scheduled CI job, where an unbounded cost is appropriate.
