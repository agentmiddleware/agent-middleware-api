"""In-process adversarial pass over the five trust-plane claims.

This module is the repo-level complement to the two credentialed HTTP
batteries — ``scripts/adversarial_battery.py`` (against a deployment you
operate) and ``scripts/red_team_trust_plane.py`` (a local SQLite red-team).
Those drive the plane from the *outside*. Two of the five claims cannot be
broken from outside without operator credentials and cannot be induced over
the wire at all, so they are proven here, against the real FastAPI routers and
services, where a test can seed a scoped permit and drive an upstream to die
mid-flight:

    Claim 1 — Charge-once under retry.
        One idempotency key returns the original receipt with no second
        execution and no second debit. Also exercised live (deliberate retry).

    Claim 2 — Budget over-spend containment.  [credential-only]
        A permit cannot authorize spend beyond its cap, cumulatively across a
        sequence of calls, and a denied call moves no money. The live battery
        explicitly does NOT exercise this (it needs a tool with a known
        per-call cost and a seeded permit) — see the note in
        ``scripts/adversarial_battery.py`` and ``docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md``.

    Claim 3 — Interrupted-invocation accounting.  [credential-only]
        Every governed invocation ends in exactly one signed terminal
        accounting. A death *after* the dispatch checkpoint stays charged
        (``delivery_uncertain``) and is never redispatched on replay; a death
        *before* it refunds to a net-zero charge without ever executing. An
        induced timeout cannot be turned into a free retry or refund. A remote
        adversary cannot induce these boundaries deterministically; a test can.

    Claim 4 — Signed, offline-verifiable receipts.
        A receipt exported for a stranger verifies offline against the
        unauthenticated key document, through the SDK verifier that imports
        none of this application, and a single flipped byte is detected as
        tampering. This is the "receipt verification" step of the stranger
        test.

    Claim 5 — Authority-before-money denial.
        An out-of-scope attempt is denied with a specific reason *before* any
        money moves, and the denial itself is a signed receipt carrying no
        ledger linkage. The full ten-reason denial matrix lives in
        ``scripts/red_team_trust_plane.py``; this asserts the load-bearing
        invariant (no debit, signed denial) in the same suite as the rest.

Where a claim is already covered exhaustively elsewhere, this module asserts a
single representative adversarial case and cross-references the fuller suite,
rather than duplicating it. The new depth is in claims 2 and 3.

    are only transiently true: under real SQLite write contention
    ``spent_credits`` can LEAD the committed debits (a reserve commits, its debit
    loses the lock race, and the reservation is released only downward, never up
    past the cap), and a committed debit can outrun the client-visible success
    receipt (surfacing to the caller as a transient ``idempotency_in_progress``).
