"""What a contended permit write is allowed to tell the caller.

The permit reserve is the *first* guarded write on the governed money path --
it runs before the debit, the audit append and the receipt insert -- and it was
the last one whose exhaustion had no name on any MCP surface.
``PermitService._run_with_write_retry`` has minted
``PermitError("permit_write_contended")`` since the restart was introduced, and
every other governed surface classifies it: the x402 router answers 503, the
AWI path abandons its key and answers 503, the ACP bridge frees the intent. The
three MCP surfaces did not, so it fell to their catch-alls and left as an
unclassified ``internal_error``.

That is the same defect ``tests/test_receipt_write_contention_surface.py``
exists to prevent, one write earlier, and the reason it matters is the one
written on ``LedgerWriteContendedError``: a client that cannot tell an
unclassified failure from a named retryable one has to assume its money may
have moved.

Two things make this type different from the receipt's, and both are pinned
here:

- ``PermitError`` is one class carrying a dozen unrelated reasons
  (``permit_not_found``, ``dispatch_attempt_not_found``, the budget denials).
  The contention is matched as ``PermitWriteContendedError``, a subclass, so
  the ladders can match contention by type without reclassifying every permit
  denial as retryable. ``test_a_plain_permit_error_is_not_reclassified``
  is the guard on that.
- The governed idempotency record is begun *before* the reserve is attempted,
  so unlike the receipt case the retryable answer is only true if the unwind
  in ``_execute_registered_tool`` releases the record. Every surface test here
  takes the retry it was promised rather than trusting the status code.

Contention is injected at the permit service's own session factory rather than
raced, for the reason the receipt suite gives: a test that waits for a real
lock passes on a fast machine for the wrong reason.

    that the write order is refund -> release -> audit -> receipt, so the
