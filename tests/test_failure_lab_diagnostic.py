"""The diagnostic must be able to argue against the thing it is selling.

Two classes of defect are load-bearing here and neither is cosmetic.

A diagnostic that cannot print "you may not need us" is a sales page with a
progress bar on it. The PRD calls that result a feature, and a feature that is
only promised in a docstring is not implemented, so these tests drive the
branch, assert the page it produces carries no offer, and assert that the one
answer which does carry an offer is the only one that can.

A diagnostic that will send failure traffic wherever it is pointed is a
denial-of-service tool with a friendly name. These tests assert that both
authorizations are required, that neither substitutes for the other, that a
caller who follows the endpoint's own instructions reaches its real answer, and
that a credential is refused before anything parses it.

Most cases drive the decision and refusal layers from synthetic comparisons,
because those are the layers that can silently start lying. The three that
drive real runs do so in a subprocess, for a reason that is itself part of the
design: see :data:`_TWO_RUNS_DRIVER`.
