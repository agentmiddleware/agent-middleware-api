"""Every schema migration from 040 onward must ship a rollout note.

Production boot refuses to start when the database's Alembic revision differs
from the packaged head in either direction. Applying a new migration therefore
retires the previously serving image: it can no longer restart against the
upgraded database. Migration 040 crossed that boundary without a plan and
needed a same-night compatibility release, recorded in
docs/schema-040-rollout.md. This test turns that lesson into a merge
requirement: a migration lands together with a note that names its Alembic
revision id and has a heading for its rollback boundary.

The gate reads every module in migrations/versions. A file outside the
three-digit naming convention fails the test instead of slipping past a glob,
because the alembic revision command generates timestamped names by default.
The note must name the revision id the module declares, which is what the
alembic_version table records, rather than the filename stem; the two have
differed before in this repository.
