# The product is the trust plane (app/trust + the core trust routers). Everything
# else is a "proof surface" — example workloads that exercise the spine but are
# NOT the product (see README "Core platform vs. example workloads"). Tests for
# these are auto-marked `proof` so the inner dev loop can skip them:
#     make test       -> fast, core only  (pytest -m "not proof")
#     make test-all   -> full suite       (what CI runs)
# Conservative by design: when a test's surface is ambiguous, leave it OUT of
# this set so it stays in the fast (core) loop and is never silently skipped.
