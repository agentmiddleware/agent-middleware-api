PROOF SURFACE — frozen. Do not expand; see docs/PROOF_SURFACES.md.
Red-team scan modeling router
-----------------------------
Endpoints for triggering, monitoring, and reviewing SIMULATED security
scans. The backing service models a scan lifecycle across 7 attack
categories (ACL bypass, auth probes, injection, rate limit evasion,
privilege escalation, schema abuse, enumeration) but sends no traffic
and attacks nothing; it refuses to run unless its simulation flag is
explicitly enabled. The repository's real adversarial tooling is
scripts/invariant_attacks/.

Findings are structured and machine-readable.

Scans are wallet-scoped: a scan belongs to the wallet whose key launched it,
and a wallet-scoped key can read and list only its own scans. Bootstrap
admins launch ownerless scans and can read every scan.
