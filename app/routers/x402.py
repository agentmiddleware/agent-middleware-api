# the repo's 300s staleness standard (the ACP bridge's stale-intent recovery
# and the governed-MCP reconciliation sweep). Safety invariant, not a
# heuristic: a live settle makes no outbound network call at all — permit
# reservation, Ed25519 attestation signing, shadow-ledger metering, and the
# receipt write are all local DB/CPU work — so its wall-clock upper bound
# sits far below this threshold and a record older than it cannot belong to
# a live attempt. Backstop if that ever regresses: abandon() refuses
# completed or charged records, and the receipts table's
# idempotency_record_id link means a receipted record is never abandoned
# here (it takes the settled-unrecoverable branch instead).

    begin_with_record raising IdempotencyInProgressError can mean a live
    concurrent settle — or the wreckage of a process that died between
    handler.settle and idem.complete. Nothing else repairs this endpoint's
    records (reconcile_stuck_records covers only governed MCP identities,
    and no ledger_entry_id checkpoint exists here), so without this branch a
    crashed attempt wedges the key forever: every retry 409s. Port of the
    ACP bridge's stale-intent recovery, resolved by crash shape once the
    record is idle past _SETTLE_STALE_SECONDS:

    - no receipt references the record: the attempt died before the durable
      settlement record was written, and the engine's compensation (budget
      release, no receipt, no live shadow session) either ran or is covered
      by permit expiry. Record the recovery on the audit chain, abandon the
      record (abandon refuses completed/charged ones), and re-run begin so
      the retry proceeds fresh.
    - a receipt DOES reference the record: the settlement happened and is
      durable, but the original X402SettleResponse cannot be rebuilt from
      what is persisted — receipts store only request/response payload
      *hashes*, and the response's authorization dict, Ed25519 attestation
      signature, and shadow session/charge ids live nowhere reconstructable
      byte-for-byte (re-signing the attestation is only bit-stable while
      the signing key is unrotated, and the shadow ids are in unsigned
      audit metadata, not the receipt). Completing the record with guessed
      or partial fields would forge a replay, so this returns a DISTINCT
      typed 409 — x402_settled_unrecoverable_replay — telling the caller
      the key settled durably (budget consumed, receipt verifiable via
      /v1/receipts) but the verbatim response is unrecoverable. Contract
