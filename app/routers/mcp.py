"""
MCP Router
==========

Governed MCP proxy for the agent trust plane (permits, metering, receipts).

Provides:
- /mcp/tools.json - MCP manifest discovery
- /mcp/messages - JSON-RPC message handling

This enables agents to:
1. Discover ops-registered tools via tools.json
2. Invoke tools under permit + wallet metering + signed receipts

There is no SSE transport. The governed surface is the HTTP/JSON-RPC tools
subset only.

    The audit event or the receipt could not be written for a call that had

    ``AuditChainContendedError`` or ``ReceiptWriteContendedError``, so neither
    the routers' ``-32005`` handlers nor the idempotency unwind in
    ``_execute_registered_tool`` can catch it and hand a charged caller a
    "retry".

    It exists because ``-32603``/``internal_error`` was the wrong answer, not
    because the outcome is knowable. ``-32603`` is this pipeline's *unclassified*
    channel -- `docs/failure-semantics.md` defines it as "a failure the pipeline
    did not classify" -- and these two sites are the opposite of unclassified:
    each caught a typed contention error, asked whether effects were committed,
    and chose non-retryability on purpose. Reporting a deliberated state through
    the unclassified channel left operators unable to separate it from a genuine
    bug without grepping correlation ids, and left a client free to read
    "internal error" as "try again", which with a *fresh* idempotency key runs
    and charges the call a second time.

    What the name claims is only the situation, never the outcome: effects are
    committed, no receipt exists, the record is counted for manual review, and
    the caller must not retry. Whether the tool's effect landed downstream stays
    exactly as unknowable as it was. This is therefore not wedge #2 -- that wedge
    turns an ambiguous outcome into a distinct *receipted* state, and the
    defining feature here is that no receipt could be written at all. It is the
    honest name for falling out of the receipted state machine.

    every audit and receipt site past the charge declares

    type, and both budget releases that run past the charge absorb their own
    contention rather than raising it -- so the in-progress idempotency

    The permit type has to be here, not only in the routers' ladders. The
    governed record is begun before the reserve is attempted, so a contended
    reserve is exactly the case that leaves a record this invocation owns and
    no longer needs; classifying it retryable at the edge while leaving the
    record held would name a retry that meets ``idempotency_in_progress``
    forever.

    Releasing it is what makes the retryable answer true rather than merely
    polite. Reconciliation deliberately does not delete uncharged local
    records, so a record left in progress would meet every retry of that key
    with ``idempotency_in_progress`` forever: the -32005 would name a retry the

    the begin returned. A call refused with ``idempotency_in_progress`` never
    held one and audits that refusal like any other, so releasing by (wallet,
    endpoint, key) alone would delete the winner's live, uncharged row while
    the winner ran on -- freeing the key to execute and debit a second time.

    Shared by every governed terminal-failure branch (permit denied, policy
    denied, insufficient funds, tool execution failure) so the receipt contract
    and idempotency completion are written in exactly one place.

    ``effects_committed`` carries the same fact, and is read the same way, as
    the argument of that name on ``_audit_mcp_invocation``: it says whether the
    call has already run or the wallet has already moved. It exists here
    because the receipt insert can lose a write conflict for its whole budget,
    and what that loss means to the caller depends entirely on the answer.
    Pass the value the branch's own audit call passes.

    ``approval_consumed`` says whether THIS invocation spent the single-use
    human approval named by ``approval_id``. ``approval_id`` alone cannot: a
    rejected, expired or lost-race approval rides on the denial receipt as
    evidence, but ``HumanApprovalService._finalize`` consumes only an approved
    one, so that denial left nothing spent and its key may be retried. It is
    true exactly when ``_require_human_approval`` returned, which it does
    solely for the approval this call consumed.

    ``effects_committed`` states whether anything irreversible has already

    upstream dispatch went out. It has no default on purpose. An audit-chain
    loss is retryable exactly when the answer is no, and every site that writes
    one has to say which side of the charge it is on, so a site added later
    cannot inherit the retryable answer by omission. That inheritance is the
    defect this parameter exists to make unrepresentable: guarding the finalize
    loop alone left the upstream helpers and the local refund-success path free
    to hand a caller who had already run and paid a "retry".

    "No" is necessary but not sufficient, which is what ``dispatch_attempt``
    answers for. A retryable loss is unwound by ``_execute_registered_tool``,
    which frees the idempotency record so the -32005 names a retry the caller
    can actually make -- and a durable dispatch attempt makes that release
    impossible, because its NOT NULL foreign key pins the record.
