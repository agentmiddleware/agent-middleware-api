# SQLite write-conflict restart
#
# On PostgreSQL a contended row lock blocks until it is free, so a writer simply
# waits and the helpers below run their operation exactly once. SQLite in WAL
# mode cannot do that for a transaction that has already read: the read pins a
# snapshot, and if anything committed since, upgrading that snapshot to a write
# returns SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT *without consulting the busy handler* — waiting
# could only deadlock, so `PRAGMA busy_timeout` is deliberately not applied. The
# single cure the engine offers is to abandon the snapshot and run the whole
# transaction again, which is what these two functions exist to do.
#
# That is why this is a transaction-restart helper and not a generic retry: the
# operation handed in must own and rebuild its own transaction, because the one
# that raised is already poisoned and nothing inside it can be replayed.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

#: Attempts before a contended writer gives up. Chosen with the ~20ms ceiling
#: below for roughly 0.4s of worst-case contention, which is long enough to
#: outlast a burst of concurrent writers and short enough that a caller blocked
#: on it still gets an answer rather than a timeout.
