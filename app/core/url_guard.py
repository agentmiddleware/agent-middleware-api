"""Outbound-URL guard for agent-driven navigation and proxied requests.

Agent-supplied URLs reach two genuinely dangerous sinks: the AWI Playwright
bridge (a real headless browser that will happily open ``file://`` and
intranet URLs) and the behavioral sandbox's HTTP proxy mode (a raw
``aiohttp`` request). Both run inside our infrastructure, so an unchecked
URL is an SSRF primitive against link-local metadata services, RFC1918
networks, and the host filesystem.

``check_outbound_url`` returns ``None`` when the URL is safe to fetch and a
short machine-readable reason string when it must be blocked. Scheme and
literal-address checks are unconditional; hostname checks resolve DNS and
block names that resolve to non-global addresses. Resolution failure fails
closed (``dns_resolution_failed``): the guard cannot vouch for a name it
could not resolve, and the fetching client (a headless browser with its own
resolver, or a later retry) may well resolve it — possibly to an intranet
address. This matches the upstream MCP URL guard. Tests that exercise
public hostnames pin ``_resolve_host`` instead of relying on live DNS. This
is a pre-flight guard, not a substitute for network-level egress policy,
and it intentionally does not try to defeat DNS rebinding.

Setting ``ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_TARGETS=true`` (local development against
mock servers) skips only the private-address checks; non-http(s) schemes
such as ``file://`` and ``javascript:`` are never allowed.
