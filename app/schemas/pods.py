"""Pods: a named group of agent API keys under one shared budget.

A pod is not a new wallet primitive. It is a thin, labeled composition of
the existing sponsor/agent wallet hierarchy (``app/services/agent_money.py``,
``app/services/wallet_engine.py``) plus wallet-scoped key issuance
(``app/services/api_key_service.py``): one sponsor wallet holds the pod's
shared budget, and each named member is an ordinary agent wallet with its
own key, provisioned from that sponsor in a single call.

This is the smallest real version of "an agent organization — pods of
specialized agents under one budget": no new ledger, no new auth model, no
new money movement semantics. See ``app/services/pods.py`` for the
orchestration and ``docs/pods.md`` for scope notes and what this
deliberately does not do yet (no department templates, no on-demand
provisioning trigger, no cross-pod budget sharing).
