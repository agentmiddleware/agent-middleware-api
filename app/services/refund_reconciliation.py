    Nothing is durable: the receipt, the work item and the record update share
    one transaction, so every exhausted attempt rolled back whole. The same
    budget bounds the restart on a signing key retired under an attempt, so
    this is also what a rotation that lands under every attempt ends in.

    It is deliberately its own type rather than a reuse of
    ``ReceiptWriteContendedError``, which is the closest-looking fit and would
    be actively dangerous here. This site is only ever reached *after* the tool
    ran, the caller was charged and the refund already failed, and the routers
    treat that neighbouring type as the pre-effect, retryable one: the legacy
    REST ladder answers it ``409`` with "retry this key", and the unwind in
    ``_execute_registered_tool`` abandons the in-progress idempotency record to
    make that advice true. Both are correct for a receipt lost before any
    effects and catastrophic for a charge already taken -- together they would
    free the key and invite a second execution of a call the caller has already
    paid for.

    Nothing in the routers catches this type, which is the point: it reaches
    ``_finalize_unrefunded_failure``, the one caller, and is re-typed there to
    the non-retryable ``TerminalRecordContendedError``. Left uncaught by
    accident it would fall to the unclassified channel -- the bug this replaces
    -- which is bad but never unsafe, so the failure mode of forgetting the
    re-type is the honest one rather than the double-charge.

            The active key is resolved per attempt rather than once outside the

            ``ensure_active_key`` writes only when the key is not already
            active.

            It is resolved before the transaction opens because it owns its own
            session, and opening that while holding this one risks deadlocking
            the write against itself. That ordering leaves a gap of its own: a
            rotation can commit after the key is resolved and before the row
            lock, and the rejection it earns is a ``SigningKeyError``, not an
            ``OperationalError``, so the restart loop would not retry it by
            itself. ``retired_under_the_attempt`` names that one rejection as
