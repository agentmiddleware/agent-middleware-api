"""ACP commerce bridge: checkouts translated into trust-plane bounds.

ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) checkouts are translated into PermitV2
tool-execution bounds and settled via Stripe Shared Payment Tokens. The
adapter never mints credits and never writes real ledger entries: the durable
money artifacts it produces are a budget reservation on a purpose-minted
permit, a signed receipt, and a hash-chained audit event. Order ids
(``acp-{intent_id}``) are bound to the tamper-evident audit chain by being
signed into the event's metadata and indexed via ``request_id``.

Settlement-rails conformance (docs/settlement-rails.md):

* item 3 — the charged amount is derived server-side from the line items,
  never from client metadata;
* item 4 — the client-asserted ``client_total`` must equal the derived total
  exactly or the checkout is refused (``acp_total_mismatch``);
* item 5 — currency is validated against a fail-closed allowlist at the
  schema boundary and revalidated by the Stripe helper;
* item 7 — a repeated ``intent_id`` replays the original checkout result via
  the durable idempotency service and provably never charges twice (a
  wallet-scoped key derived from the intent id also rides to Stripe as the
  PaymentIntent idempotency key — see ``stripe_idempotency_key``).

The ``spt_token`` is never logged and never persisted: it is excluded from
the idempotency request payload, the receipt payloads, and the audit
metadata.
