"""x402 payment facilitation against permit budgets.

Posture — read this before extending (docs/settlement-rails.md keeps the
settlement freeze in force): x402 here is a *facilitator* surface. It parses
HTTP 402 payment requirements, authorizes them against permit budgets, and
records micro-settlements in the shadow ledger plus signed receipts. It never
mints credits and never writes real ledger entries. The payer wallet — not the
trust plane — signs the on-chain authorization (``eth_signTypedData_v4`` over
the EIP-712 payload for EVM USDC; Solana's native Ed25519 for Solana). What
this module signs is an Ed25519 *facilitator attestation*: evidence that the
trust plane authorized and metered the payment, never the secp256k1 on-chain
authorization itself. There is no keccak and no EVM key anywhere in this repo,
by design.
