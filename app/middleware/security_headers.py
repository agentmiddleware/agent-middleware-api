"""Baseline security response headers for the API origin.

The API answers with JSON, a Swagger UI, and a few first-party HTML pages.
None of those need to be sniffed, framed, or referred with a full URL, so the
same three headers the marketing origin already sends belong here too. HSTS is
only emitted for requests that actually arrived over TLS, so plain-HTTP local
development is unaffected and the header is never sent where a browser must
ignore it.

Content-Security-Policy is path-aware: JSON has nothing to execute, first-party
HTML (dashboard, approval cards) is inline-CSS only, and FastAPI's stock
Swagger UI / ReDoc need jsDelivr plus an inline boot script, a blob: Web Worker,
and Google Fonts. Cache-Control: no-store is the default on tenant-sensitive
paths; public discovery stays cacheable so agents can keep OpenAPI and
well-known documents.

# Two entries exist only because ReDoc's stock bundle needs them, and both are
# load-bearing for /redoc rendering at all:
#   - worker-src blob: — redoc.standalone.js starts its parser in a Web Worker
#     built with `new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([...])))`. worker-src
#     falls back to script-src, which does not allow blob:, so without this the
#     worker is blocked and the page never renders.
#   - fonts.googleapis.com / fonts.gstatic.com — FastAPI's get_redoc_html emits
#     a Google Fonts stylesheet (with_google_fonts defaults to True), and the
#     stylesheet pulls its font files from gstatic.
# Allowing blob: workers here costs nothing this policy was still holding back:
# script-src on these two paths already allows 'unsafe-inline'.
