# CrewAI + Agent Middleware API

CrewAI integration for the Agent Middleware API via governed **permit → invoke → receipt** flow.

All tool invocations go through the trust plane: scoped permits, signed receipts, replay protection, and metered billing.

**Status:** source-only integration example, not a published package. Start
with the [documentation guide](../../docs/README.md) to evaluate the supported
one-tool MCP path before adopting a framework wrapper.

## Installation

This package is not published to PyPI. Install it from a checkout of
this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentmiddleware/agent-middleware-api.git
cd agent-middleware-api
python -m pip install -e ./b2a_sdk
python -m pip install -e ./wrappers/crewai-agent-middleware
```

`b2a_sdk` must be installed from the local path first: this package
depends on `b2a-sdk>=0.4.0`, which is not on PyPI, so installing the
wrapper on its own fails to resolve. That installs the `crewai_b2a`
module used below.

## Quick Start (Governed Flow)

```python
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_b2a import CrewAIB2ATool

# Initialize tool with required wallet_id and api_key
b2a_tool = CrewAIB2ATool(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    wallet_id="agent-001",
)

# Create agent with B2A tool
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Research topics using available tools",
    backstory="An expert researcher with access to MCP tools",
    tools=[b2a_tool],
)
```

## Operations

### Discover Tools

```python
# Discover available MCP tools
result = b2a_tool.run(operation="discover_tools")
```

### Call Tool (Governed Flow)

```python
# Call an MCP tool with caller-supplied idempotency keys
# The wrapper creates a permit, invokes the tool, and returns a signed receipt
result = b2a_tool.run(
    operation="call_tool",
    tool_name="data-indexer",
    idempotency_key="unique-invoke-123",  # REQUIRED: caller must supply
    permit_idempotency_key="permit-invoke-123",  # REQUIRED: stable for replay
    arguments={"documents": ["..."]},
)

# Result includes signed receipt
# "{'content': [...], 'receipt_id': '...', 'credits_charged': '2', 'signature': '...'}"
```

### Check Balance

```python
result = b2a_tool.run(operation="balance")
```

## Idempotency and Replay Protection

Both `idempotency_key` and `permit_idempotency_key` are **required** and must be supplied by the caller. Do not auto-generate keys.

An identical replay with the same invocation key returns the original receipt
without recharging. `idempotency_key` identifies one governed invocation, and
the gateway rejects that key reused with changed invocation input with an
idempotency conflict (`IdempotencyConflictError`; on `/mcp/messages` the gateway
reports it as a JSON-RPC `-32603` `idempotency_key_reused` error rather than an
HTTP 409). `permit_idempotency_key` makes permit creation
repeatable; it does not make a changed invocation an idempotent replay.

```python
# First call: charges credits
result1 = b2a_tool.run(
    operation="call_tool",
    tool_name="partner.search",
    idempotency_key="search-abc-123",
    permit_idempotency_key="permit-abc-123",
    arguments={"query": "test"},
)

# Valid replay: same request returns the cached receipt, no additional charge
result2 = b2a_tool.run(
    operation="call_tool",
    tool_name="partner.search",
    idempotency_key="search-abc-123",  # same invoke key
    permit_idempotency_key="permit-abc-123",  # same permit key
    arguments={"query": "test"},  # same arguments
)
```

## Permit Configuration

Control permit budget and TTL:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

b2a_tool = CrewAIB2ATool(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    wallet_id="agent-001",
    permit_budget=Decimal("50"),  # max 50 credits per permit
    permit_ttl_minutes=15,         # permit expires in 15 minutes
)
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- CrewAI 0.1.0+
- httpx 0.25.0+

## Release checklist (not yet run)

This package has not been published to PyPI or submitted to any CrewAI
marketplace. Nothing here has been uploaded; release needs C.Lee's decision.
When C.Lee approves, the checklist is:

1. Confirm `b2a-sdk` is published to PyPI first, since this wrapper depends
   on it and a published package cannot depend on a checkout-only package.
2. Build from this directory with `python -m build` (or `uv build`) and run
   `twine check dist/*`; both must pass.
3. Smoke test in a fresh virtualenv: `pip install` the built wheel plus the
   published `b2a-sdk`, then `python -c "import crewai_b2a"`.
4. Run `pytest tests/` from this directory and confirm it passes.
5. Tag and publish with `twine upload dist/*`, then announce the version.
