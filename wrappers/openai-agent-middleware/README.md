# OpenAI + Agent Middleware API

OpenAI function-calling and Agents SDK integration for the Agent Middleware API
via the governed **permit → invoke → receipt** flow.

**Status:** source-only integration example, not a published package. Start
with the [documentation guide](../../docs/README.md) to evaluate the supported
one-tool MCP path before adopting a framework wrapper. This wrapper has not
been exercised against a live OpenAI model in this repository's CI; its tests
drive the governed loop with recorded tool-call shapes.

## The one idea: the model's `tool_call.id` is the operation identity

Every tool call OpenAI emits carries an id (`call_…`) that is assigned once
and lives in the conversation transcript your application already persists.
A retry of the same tool call — after a dropped connection, a crashed worker,
a resumed run — therefore carries the same id. That is exactly what the trust
plane's `Idempotency-Key` exists to capture, so `GovernedToolRunner`:

1. derives the key from the id (`oai-<tool_call.id>`) and **never invents
   one** — a tool call without an id is refused, because an invented key would
   turn the retry into a second charged action;
2. writes the derivation to an `OperationKeyStore` **before the first network
   call**, so a crash between "the model asked" and "the receipt came back"
   resumes with the same key;
3. issues one permit per `(run_id, tool)` under a stable key, recording the
   permit's `expires_at` first so a retried permit request is byte-for-byte
   identical and the server replays it instead of rejecting it.

The server side of the same contract is described in
[`docs/failure-semantics.md`](../../docs/failure-semantics.md): a key that is
present but malformed is refused with `-32602 invalid_idempotency_key` before
anything is minted or charged.

## Installation

This package is not published to PyPI. Install it from a checkout of this
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PetrefiedThunder/agent-middleware-api.git
cd agent-middleware-api
python -m pip install -e ./b2a_sdk
python -m pip install -e wrappers/openai-agent-middleware
```

`b2a_sdk` must be installed from the local path first: this package depends
on `b2a-sdk>=0.3.0`, which is not on PyPI. The `openai` package is optional
(`pip install -e "wrappers/openai-agent-middleware[openai]"`): the runner
accepts the tool-call objects any OpenAI SDK version emits, and plain dicts.

## Chat Completions (function calling)

```python
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from openai_b2a import B2AClient, GovernedToolRunner, JsonFileOperationKeyStore

async def main() -> None:
    trust = B2AClient(api_key="<wallet-scoped key>", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000")
    runner = GovernedToolRunner(
        trust,
        wallet_id="<your wallet id>",
        run_id="job-2026-09-05-001",           # stable across a resume of this run
        key_store=JsonFileOperationKeyStore("operations.json"),
    )
    tools = [
        runner.register_tool(
            "partner.notes.write",
            description="Append a note to the partner notebook.",
            parameters={"type": "object", "properties": {"text": {"type": "string"}}},
        )
    ]

    openai = AsyncOpenAI()
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Write the note: shipped the fix."}]
    completion = await openai.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o", messages=messages, tools=tools)
    assistant = completion.choices[0].message
    messages.append(assistant)

    # Each tool call becomes exactly one governed action; retries replay.
    for outcome in await runner.run_all(assistant.tool_calls or []):
        messages.append(outcome.as_tool_message())
        print(outcome.receipt.receipt_id, outcome.receipt.credits_charged)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Responses API / Agents SDK

`function_call` items carry the operation identity in `call_id` (the item's own
`id` is *not* used). Hand the item to the same runner and append the result as
a `function_call_output`:

```python
outcome = await runner.run(item)                 # item.type == "function_call"
input_items.append(outcome.as_function_call_output())
```

## Resuming after a crash

Keep `operations.json` (or your own `OperationKeyStore` implementation) with
the run's transcript. Construct a new runner with the **same `run_id`** and the
same store, and replay the transcript's tool calls: every call that already
completed returns its original receipt, every call that was interrupted
finishes as one action, and nothing is charged twice. A run resumed after its
permits expired needs a new `run_id`.

## What is refused client-side

| Input | Why |
| --- | --- |
| tool call without an id, or with a blank/padded/non-printable id | no operation identity to persist; an invented key would make retries new actions |
| tool call id longer than 124 characters | `oai-` + id would exceed the trust plane's 128-character key column |
| a recorded tool call replayed under a different tool name | the operation identity is bound to one action |
| two MCP tools whose names collapse to the same OpenAI function name | the runner could not map the model's call back |

## Tests

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m pytest wrappers/openai-agent-middleware/tests -q
```

The in-repository test `tests/test_openai_wrapper_trust_loop.py` also drives
this runner against the real trust plane in-process: a retried tool call
returns the same signed receipt and produces one ledger debit.
