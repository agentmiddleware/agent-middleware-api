# running instance: golden path, sequential replay, 15-way identical concurrent
# admission with safe in-progress responses, post-completion replay,
# idempotency-key conflict on a changed payload, budget denial, expired and
# forged permits, receipt and audit-chain verification, and tenant isolation.
# Requires AGENT_MIDDLEWARE_API_KEY (a bootstrap/admin key) plus either an
# explicit AGENT_MIDDLEWARE_API_URL or `TRUST_CONFORMANCE_ARGS="--api-url ..."`.
